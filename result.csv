    ",Jewboy Burgers,"Burgers are yummy and big, well worth the price. I just got the simple burger, it is simple but perfect seasoning, cooked right * (not dry) and well put together from the bun to toppings. Only complaint if felt like mine had too many pickles for my personal preference, but ate the whole dam thing. ,Also got the queso, which is really good but wasn't my preference since it was all packed with jalapeños and too spicy for me (another personal preference). Would go back for sure, probably not everyday because it's definitely a guilty indulgence. Also you have to get the cookie!,Burgers are yummy and big, well worth the price.

It's the kind of burger that makes you think about selling your backyard grill because you know you'll never be able to top this at home. I went with the standard Jewboy burger and was not disappointed. I also missed the lunch hour crowd and was served quickly (bonus!).,I'm not what anyone would consider a food truck foodie, but I'll definitely return to try some of their other offerings.,Holy moly, is this a good burger.

I cannot stress it enough. The owner is extremely nice, his employees are great. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. I've been all around Austin looking for the best burger and this one is definitely in my top 5. ,I got the Jewboy burger, it was perfect. I was satisfied and the taste was amazing. They are really dog friendly. The burger meat is real meat. It's not that frozen crap, freshly hand crafted. ,Get the chips and queso. One order should be enough for a few people. ,Once again. The hospitality just elevated this joint from great to outstanding. Highly recommend it.,This place is AMAZING!!! I cannot stress it enough. The owner is extremely nice, his employees are great.

I'd just finished reading his story and the origin of the food truck's name and we got to chatting a bit after I put an order in for an original Jewboy burger (minus the cheese today) and a pair of chopped onion and garlic latkes - a sort of cross between potato pancakes and hash browns. ,Among other things, we laughed over the fact that the food truck doesn't follow kosher law - meat and milk products together, for example.  As a matter of fact, I wonder if you *could* make a mobile kitchen like a food truck kosher!  But I digress...,Mo's burgers are supposed to be 1/3rd of a pound, but I could swear they're bigger.  They're served with a bit of onion cooked into the patty, and they're cradled in these amazingly soft and chewy potato rolls.  Heavenly!  Also, you've got to try the latkes - crispy, onion-y and potato-y, it's so good that I don't even care if I made up half the words in this sentence.,Finally, be sure to ask for a side of schmutz when you put in your order.  I get the sense this item is a 'trial balloon' for people but it's very good.  It's a sort of garlic aoli and not only is it good to dip your potatoes in, add a bit on top of your burger.  Garlic and grilled meat work wonders together.  ,On a side note, I'm 99% sure that schmutz is Yiddish for 'dust' or 'debris'.  I've heard it used in that context: ""Hey, before you take the picture, get that schmutz off the lens."",Thanks for the burger and the great sides, Mo!,This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.,5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.,4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.,3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.,2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.,1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good.

The burgers were seasoned awesomely and super tasty. At first I thought I would only eat half, but had to finish to rest off. The queso is sooooo delish!  We tried a mild one and with green chili's. The chili one was so good and the hot had a nice creep up. The mild was creamy deliciousness. He gave us 2 sodas and a cookie gratis since we patiently waited for the queso. That Apple soda is a GO! Try it! Cookie was soft and lemony tasty. We can't wait to go back!,This was the best burger experience I had in a long time. We tried the original and the oye vay and queso.

He cracked some jokes and explained lots of things on the menu, as it was our first time. We got the burger (aye vay? Something like that) with the roasted peppers in it, which he recommended for people who like spicy things.,It is not spicy at all but has a teeny tiny small kick in it. The burger itself was big, flavorful and juicy. I wish it had some sort of sauce with it on the side, but it's not necessary since it's delicious on its own. We got the sour cream and onion latke which was just basically a crispy hash brown but it was delicious!! You have to get it with a meal. ,I would definitely recommend this place for burgers in Austin!

My wife and I stopped in to get our fix tonight. She opted for the Jewboy Burger and I had the Oye Vay Guey. We also got the chips and queso and the onion and garlic latkes. They were all fantastic!,The latkes were perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy in the center. The garlic in them was the star of the show. We both agreed that these alone were worth the trip.,We then had the chips and queso. It was a great melty white cheese with grilled onions and green chilis. We both agreed that it was easily some of the top queso in this queso city of ours.,To the main event, the meat in the burgers was fantastic and and the perfect amount of crunchy on the edges. The green chilis on my burger had some great heat. We both agreed that their decision to add mustard to the burgers was the the right one. There was enough mustard kick to cut through the meatiness of the burger. Order these burgers the way they are designed, Mo knows his burgers.,We can't wait to make a return visit.,I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to see what Jewboy Burgers were all about.

While the toppings aren't extravagant individually (cheese, onion, lettuce, mustard, etc.), together they create a hearty burger. The burger is a generous size and matches the price in my opinion. I feel the latkes are kind of expensive for only two, but were deliciously crispy. Also enjoyed  a black and white cookie - the frosting didn't have that fake sweet taste and was the perfect size. ,Service was great - my food didn't take long to come out, and Mo, the owner, is super awesome! Jewboy is located at the food truck park on Burnet, so there's a shared parking lot. Only downside is there's no seating in front of JewBoy.,I recommend JewBoy Burgers if you want something more than just a typical burger & fries.,I may have only gone to JewBoy Burgers because it was the only food truck open on a rainy night, but I'm so glad for that. ,Ordered the original JewBoy Burger and potato latkes.

I wish I could share a picture of what I ate, alas I devoured it the second I got it. Trying to watch my carbs but also a lover of latkes I ordered the Goyim without the bun (sad, I know) but added a latke on top. Holy sh#t!!!! I can't even begin to describe the juicy, flavor packed punch that smacked my taste buds silly. Everyone that I was with all got something different but agreed this place is amazing. I don't think anyone spoke for a good 10 minutes because that would stop us from eating for too long. Besides the food, customer service is beyond customer service. It's more like when you meet new friends and you're over to their house for the first time and the conversation is just flowing. The nicest people. Delicious food.

I cannot wait to comeback to Austin just for this burger alone.,I am a burger fan.. seriously I travel and eat at a NEW burger spot once a month around Austin and where ever I travel. I FINALLY made it to meet Mo at Jewboy Burgers and it was well worth the travel while sadly informing myself ""why did I wait so long?"", All of Mo's burgers are artisan creations in flavors and layers. Each ingredient has an intended purpose on the burger. Mo does not simply put it on there because it should be there, he puts it on the burger because that is how he intended it to be; a balance of flavor and experience. (if you want it a certain way, Mo will oblige you, but trust me.. let him make it the way it is intended),  The best thing that you can add to Jewboy Burgers is Mo himself. I happened to get the chance to talk with him for about an hour since it was in a slow period. The man LOVES BURGERS. He is not afraid to note that he eats at a few other places for the love of burgers. He also enjoys the experiences to what those chefs and cooks present in their own creations. For Mo it is NOT about the competition, but the experience in eating a good burger. After all, we interpret each flavor differently, so he enjoys the experience all around.,  All in all, come here and meet a man who crafts these creations layer by layer with purpose and intent. It may be the simple bite of the mustard on the BOTTOM bun versus Mayo on the TOP of one; trust me, this changes the flavor experience and Mo knows!,  So far my favorite is the Oye Vay Guey burger with the FRESH green chilies that he cooks to perfection and picks them out fresh daily for his flat top., I might add, get a ""Mexican"" coke with it because that real sugar taste balances well with the flavor of the meal.,  Make it a single, make it a double, but always get it the way Mo makes it! Your taste buds will thank you for it and you will see why he has been featured on Food Network, Travel Channel, and food tours that come by here to eat.,I am a burger fan.. seriously I travel and eat at a NEW burger spot once a month around Austin and where ever I travel. I FINALLY made it to meet Mo at Jewboy Burgers and it was well worth the travel while sadly informing myself ""why did I wait so long?"", All of Mo's burgers are artisan creations in flavors and layers.

They're a bit greasy, but that's the only real complaint I have for the burgers the 2 different burgers I've had from them are really great. The main reason why I docked a star from them though is because they didn't tell me the correct time when the burger was ready, and I was working at the time so while I waited there my manager called me mad at me wondering why I was late coming back. So yea... I mean they were busy at the time so I don't know... anyways they're great and I will definitely keep on coming back here for my burger fix.,Really great burgers. Been here twice so far.

It was originally kind of hard to find and parking was tough since they have a small front parking, but there is still space in the back. The interior is a lot different compared  to the outside. Since it was our first time, we were recommended to try the tumeric fish and the pork ribs rice box. It was so good. Everything about the rice box was great. From the meats to the veggies and even the rice. I didnt know how favorful garlic rice could be. I would recommend anyone that passes by to check this place out.,This place is definitely what I call a hidden gem.

You cannot get out of the parking spaces at Heo without directly backing out onto Lamar.

Fish was yummy and so was the rice with bits of crunchy stuff. Super flavorful. Veggies on the side were okay, but tasted a lot better with hoisin sauce and sriracha.

It would be nice if they sold the sticks individually.,The frozen yogurt was AWESOME! Even though I was super full after eating the rice box and some of the pork, I didn't feel gross at all while eating the frozen yogurt. It was a small but perfectly-sized portion.

This was on a list of must try's so we headed there around 7. When we got there, there was a wait with two people ahead of us so we didn't mind! ,The only reason I'm giving 4 is because the hostess quoted 20 minutes but we waited over an hour. We were starving by the time we got our table. The steak was great and the duck was okay. Not sure if we'll return but the ambiance was nice.,Came here on a date night with my boyfriend.

Not sure if we'll return but the ambiance was nice.,I'm in between a 3 and a 4 for Fabi + Rosi., ,Situated in a little house structure, Fabi + Rosi makes for a cute, intimate setting, date night. The interiors are decorated really pretty, with low lights, and candles on a table. It's a place you'd wanna take a date to. The prices on the menu are reasonable, with dishes being of decent portions too. ,I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday. We started off with the brotzeit, which was delicious, but the cheese and sausage was too salty for my liking. The pretzel though, was good. For mains, I ordered the schnitzel, which was breaded evenly and nicely, and the schnitzels were pounded thin and evenly. The spatzle was a good accompaniment to it too. My boyfriend ordered the steak, which tasted fine, but was a little too over cooked (he wanted medium rare, and it was almost fully cooked), and was very chewy. The truffle fries that came at the side could definitely do with more truffle flavor.,Service at the place was great. Our server, Emily, was very attentive and knew when to come by and checked on us, and when to leave us be. ,Generally, my experience with Fabi + Rosi is decent. The biggest drawback about the place is that it is difficult to hold a celebration dinner there. They do not take reservations for groups under 6 pax, even for special occasions. Also, they charge a cake fee of 10$, which is understandable, if the establishment has great desserts, but Fabi + Rosi does not boast a strong menu in this aspect. They also do take a little long to get back to your emails, I had to follow up on my email to hear back from them. ,All in all, it was a decent experience, beautiful place, decent food, great service, but also pretty difficult to hold celebrations. I definitely do not recommend anyone trying to celebrate special occasions here, unless you have a bigger group. Maybe just a regular dinner, but do come early if you want to skip the line.,I'm in between a 3 and a 4 for Fabi + Rosi., ,Situated in a little house structure, Fabi + Rosi makes for a cute, intimate setting, date night.

Maybe just a regular dinner, but do come early if you want to skip the line.,Overall, this is a cute place to get dinner if you're in the mood for French cuisine. The price is a bit too high and not worth it but I'm glad I came to check out this place based on high reviews on Yelp.,The atmosphere is very romantic. It's very dimly lit inside and a bit loud so it's a little difficult to hear what the person in front of you is saying. If you want to go on a romantic date somewhere, then this is your place.,Now onto the food! ,Duck confit- This was my favorite dish of the night. Duck was cooked medium well (just to my liking) and the bell peppers were sautéd well- very tasty. There were potato 'fries' which this dish could've done without- it wasn't good at all (very bland and chewy). ,Duck Breast (sliced)- This was not so good. Duck didn't have that 'wow' factor. It didn't have much flavor either which made the dish not so enjoyable.,Salmon- This was pretty flavorful and very healthy. The sides it came with complimented the fish very well.,Chicken Breast- I know the menu had some fancy name for this dish but the actual chicken was delicious.,Crack Cake- Thanks to our server, this was complimentary since we were celebrating my brother's birthday so that was very nice. It came out with a sparkler which was neat. The actual desert was tasty. ,Chevre Tart with Preserved Candied Lemon- This was surprisingly pretty good! The candied lemons wasn't overpowering. The tart was light and airy. Definitely worth trying.,Overall, this is a cute place to get dinner if you're in the mood for French cuisine.

Some of the main dishes come with wine/drink suggestions, which I thought was a nice touch. ,Taking off one star because of the price and somewhat long wait. Not terribly expensive but I did feel like I got ripped off for a $28 plate (lobster risotto) that was half the size of everyone else's dish. We came around 6 on a Friday night and were seated right away but took at least 30 minutes for our main dishes. Granted it was the day after Thanksgiving so they were busy.,Overall really nice place!

The soup of the day was red pepper soup, which was tasty. I got the steak and fries that came with a small salad of string beans, tomatoes, and red onion. A lot of European, especially French restaurants, tend to give you small serving sizes but the amount of food I was given was perfect. I decided to get the chevere (I think that's what it is?) tart. It was honestly the best part of the meal because it had a good flavor and is made with goat cheese. The waiter, a tall guy with red hair, was nice and attentive.

We often end up just eating that with bread or a spoon like a soup since it's so good. They suggest getting the Truffle Fries with them - I wouldn't say they go together to be honest, but the Truffle Fries are really great too, at least if you like thick cut fries with coarse salt and the truffle oil aftertaste. ,We also recently tried the Escargot which is also full of flavor. I had actually tried Escargot in France before and wasn't a huge fan, but with the way it's done here (I assume a modern take on it) I really enjoyed it.,There are also a few fun options for meat/cheese boards, with the Käse Board being a pretty traditional board with a few cheeses and meats, while the Brotzeit Board has cooked bratwurst and beer cheese and a pretzel all of which are pretty solid. ,One thing we have tried that wasn't our favorite was the Kraftbrühe, which is a Beef Consomeé with Bone Marrow Dumplings in it - it just didn't have enough substance for our taste. ,Last thing worth mentioning here is the beer selection, since they have German beer options that are otherwise very hard to find (don't even see these at Banger's which has a huge beer selection, German and otherwise).,We've been here for happy hour a handful of times now, and the #1 reason we keep coming back is the PEI Mussels - they are amazing.,This small restaurant can be hard to miss but is really worth a visit, since good European food can be hard to find and they really do it justice here, not to mention the ambiance and service are phenomenal. ,Definitely check out the PEI Mussels when you visit, and not just the meat itself but the broth in which they are sitting in particular, since that is the killer flavor.

They never asked us what doneness we wanted for the steak, which I found weird, but given how thin the steak was, I'm guessing it's hard to make it anything but well done.

Glad we got all three because they were all good. Escargot is hard to get right in the US, but I'd say this one is worth trying, especially if it's your first time.,The Wagyu sirloin (medium rare) was just okay, but it's only $24 for 8 oz. So I can't complain.,The wine selection is not extensive but they have several great options from around Europe. We just got the cheapest option, the Bordeaux, and got a second bottle because it was pretty good for the price.,I also loved the ambiance.

How we haven't been here yet, I don't know. ,The restaurant is quaint and the finish out is super cute and cozy. ,When we first arrived, there was a wait, so we made ourselves cozy on the couch and ordered a class of wine. ,We ended up ordering the escargot and fried oysters for starters. They were both delicious. However, the escargot was perfection. ,For our meals, we ordered the duck and trout. The duck was perfectly tender. The grits were magnificent and  creamy and the Brussels Sprouts were wonderful. The trout was fresh and cooked just right. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the tomato pairing. I thought the tomato salad was really good, just not great with the trout. ,Overall, I highly recommend and I will be back.,We were trying to figure out where to eat last night and we're debating on trying one of the new restaurants, but decided to try Fabi + Rosi.

One was disappointed in the Schnitzel - he found it bland - the waiter immediately offered to swap it out for another dish which arrived promptly.  They served up my birthday cake - brought in by my friends - and they were so gracious especially since we were the last party to leave.  We all said we would come back soon - Happy HOUR!!,Wonderful Birthday Dinner,Thank you Fabi and Rosi for a wonderful dinner experience.  I was taken to dinner by friends and since we had a party of 7 we made reservations.  The table was ready when we arrived, it was set in an alcove so it felt private but we could see the whole restaurant.  I had the Wagyu Sirloin (very rare) with a light gravy (perfectly peppery) and amazing thick fries - I was so happy.  Everyone was happy with their dishes (Escargot, Halibut, Ravioli).

We opted for the ""bar"" instead of a 45 mins wait and ended up getting a private corner by ourselves.,The food? Gosh they were good.,Kraftbruhe (non-vegetarian soup) -- Beef and bone marrow soup. The bone marrows were rolled up into tiny balls (or dumplings as they call it). The soup was flavorful and the beef and the bone marrows complemented each other well.,Lobster Risotto -- I'm a sucker for risotto so this was an obvious pick. The cook on the risotto was on the more acidic side but it went well with the giant piece of buttery lobster meat that's on top. If you like risotto, you'll love this.,Duck Breast -- The duck was absolutely delicious but I think the brussel sprouts actually stole the show. There are a lot of restaurants putting their own unique spin to brussel sprouts. This might be the best in Austin. Both my wife and I were blown away by how much flavor they were able to pack into each bite of the sprouts. I don't get it.,Goat Cheese Cake -- Here's the thing. We hate goat cheese. But for whatever reason, the reviews here and our waiter convinced us to give it a shot... and it was delicious. We could still taste the goat cheese but we actually liked the flavor this time.

Tender texture, starts off tasting like chicken, but has an after taste that's a bit gamey.

With some significant misses, however, there's still room for improvement. Would currently give them 3.5 stars. ,We dined on a recent Sunday, with a reservation made online. I think we could have gotten away without one, with only about 50-60% of the tables occupied. The dining room is fairly spacious, light & airy, designed in a warm and modern aesthetic. There's a posh little bar serving up a variety of cocktails, and a dining area with tables and a couple of booths.,We ordered a few appetizers, two mains, and desserts. The appetizers stole the show.

Two grilled slices of Haloumi cheese, whose saltiness is brilliantly balanced with a tart and refreshing serving of zucchini and cherry tomatoes in a wonderfully refreshing, lemony vinaigrette. I could've ordered two for myself alone! My partner ordered the quail appetizer which was also well done. The entrees: My partner ordered a burger, which he requested with bacon. What he got was actually two thick slices of pork belly--great if you like pork belly, less so if what you wanted was bacon. I had the cauliflower steak which was full of flavor and very filling. Dessert was again, promising, but fell short on delivery. The upside down nectarine cake was spectacular, but the short bread biscuit on the strawberry shortcake was utterly tasteless and made me sad. ,Finally, a word on service: friendly, but terribly slow.

Lamar.,We decided to try it out. It took some doing to locate the entrance - it is not easily visible. We tried entering on the North Lamar side, but found a sign there stating to use the main entrance. So we walked back towards the courtyard, which we could not access from 39th street. Finally, we saw a man and child walking towards it and they explained where the main entrance is. I suggest they move the sandwich sign they have placed near the door out by the fire lane, near the small white sign with Rosedale in navy blue script. ,The restaurant was open for it's first Monday evening service, which they explained when we entered. Our first impression was that the owners must have poured a fortune into the renovation because the design is simply stunning. There is an open kitchen that is very neatly organized, with mason jars on a high shelf filled with some interesting ingredients. The ceiling has light wood with geometric pattern inlays and perfectly placed halogen lights highlighting the tabletops. The light colored walls and vertical, gray, stone subway tiles that line the kitchen walls allow the color of the dishes to be the star. There are several types of seating options, including a large u-shaped leather sofa in the bar area. The photos I have attached do not do it justice.,We started with a Caesar salad ($10), which included the perfect amount of lemony-garlic dressing. My friend ordered a salad bowl, with quinoa, cucumbers, kale, heirloom tomatoes, etc. The bite I had was cool and refreshing and tasted like a mouthful of summer. My friend mentioned she would have liked more dressing yet she enjoyed the salad.,I could not resist the Rosedale Steak ($28), which was a delicious wagyu that was first sous vide, then placed on the grill and served, with grill marks, over buttery mashed potatoes. It was a perfect medium rare and wonderfully seasoned. The accompanying grilled broccolini added a vibrant color and healthiness to the plate.,We opted for the nectarine upside-down cake for dessert, served with halved fresh dark cherries, shaved raw almonds, sliced nectarine, and a small scoop of honey ice cream. It was so beautifully tempting that we forgot to take a picture before diving in.,Before I snapped the pictures, I approached the kitchen and asked permission from the head chef and other important-looking person standing next to her. They were both very friendly and welcoming, as were all the employees who interacted with us. I really enjoyed Rosedale Kitchen and Bar and look forward to visiting again the next time I am in Austin.,I was meeting a friend who works nearby and stumbled upon this place earlier in the day, when I quickly stopped in at Kendra Scott, which is located in the same building on the northwest corner of 38th and N. Lamar.,We decided to try it out. It took some doing to locate the entrance - it is not easily visible. We tried entering on the North Lamar side, but found a sign there stating to use the main entrance. So we walked back towards the courtyard, which we could not access from 39th street. Finally, we saw a man and child walking towards it and they explained where the main entrance is. I suggest they move the sandwich sign they have placed near the door out by the fire lane, near the small white sign with Rosedale in navy blue script. ,The restaurant was open for it's first Monday evening service, which they explained when we entered. Our first impression was that the owners must have poured a fortune into the renovation because the design is simply stunning. There is an open kitchen that is very neatly organized, with mason jars on a high shelf filled with some interesting ingredients. The ceiling has light wood with geometric pattern inlays and perfectly placed halogen lights highlighting the tabletops. The light colored walls and vertical, gray, stone subway tiles that line the kitchen walls allow the color of the dishes to be the star. There are several types of seating options, including a large u-shaped leather sofa in the bar area. The photos I have attached do not do it justice.,We started with a Caesar salad ($10), which included the perfect amount of lemony-garlic dressing. My friend ordered a salad bowl, with quinoa, cucumbers, kale, heirloom tomatoes, etc. The bite I had was cool and refreshing and tasted like a mouthful of summer. My friend mentioned she would have liked more dressing yet she enjoyed the salad.,I could not resist the Rosedale Steak ($28), which was a delicious wagyu that was first sous vide, then placed on the grill and served, with grill marks, over buttery mashed potatoes. It was a perfect medium rare and wonderfully seasoned. The accompanying grilled broccolini added a vibrant color and healthiness to the plate.,We opted for the nectarine upside-down cake for dessert, served with halved fresh dark cherries, shaved raw almonds, sliced nectarine, and a small scoop of honey ice cream.

We (6 adults, 2 toddlers) were seated easily with our reservation. The service was attentive and fast, except that it took a bit longer to get our check than we'd like. (That could be interpreted positively, since we definitely didn't feel rushed.) The food came out quickly, especially for a Friday night.,The food: We tried several appetizers - the pimiento cheese, crab and crisps, quail, and hummus. All were delicious, though the hummus needs more veg. My pimiento-hating wife literally stole the dish from me, it was that good. For the entrees, we ordered both steaks, the Caesar salad, the roasted chicken, the market fish (monkfish), and an off-menu soft-shell crab. Zero complaints - everything was tasty - but the winners were the NY strip, the fish, and the chicken. Seriously, they were all great and you can't go wrong with that selection. For dessert, we tried the gluten-free brownie, the nectarine upside down cake, and the shortbread. The brownie and upside down cake were delicious.,The kids loved a few of the dishes, but that's always a crapshoot, so good luck. We did appreciate that the kid's menu was more than your typical mac & cheese and chicken strips. There's ample space outside to take them out to run or poke around the restaurant's garden.,Long story short: go check this place out.

This is where I got confused with what they are going for... Asian fusion kind of thing or what? It was just salty. The pork belly sandwich - the pork belly on point but in a sandwich??? Nooooo... it ruined the integrity of the pork belly, you can't put a greasy meat in a sandwich with a dressing,  that is a no no no then with fries on the side???.. this couldve been their signature dish If paired with something else but not bread.

The food is delicious, the ambiance is warm, and the staff is helpful and accommodating. There is something on the menu for everyone: the vegan, the paleo, and the comfort-food obsessed. Have allergies? Have no fear. The kitchen will make sure you are taken care of without any side eye from the wait staff when you ask for the gluten free option. The Crab & Crisps is the lightest and sweetest adaptation of crab dip that I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. No heaviness, all the flavor. The pancetta and pepper jelly in the Shrimp Creole creates the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The fresh tomatoes and zucchini on the seared haloumi taste like they were picked off the vine that day. Oh yeah, did I mention they use produce grown out of their organic garden in front of the restaurant? The crispy chicken with roasted corn and okra exemplified summer in the south. I haven't stopped craving the pan roasted salmon dish since I finished slurping up my last sweet potato noodle. I ended the night with the strawberry shortcake, and dare I say it was better than my mom's recipe. The fresh berries, the scratch made biscuit, and the whipped mascarpone....to die for.

We learned that the chef was a Chopped winner in 2013 but apparently worked as a private chef until resuming her career at this restaurant. Let's start with service. Warm, welcoming, intuitive, and surprisingly quick (even though the locally-sourced menu selections are probably made from scratch). everything on the menu seems very Austin, and I don't see anything I wouldn't like to try. They have a very reasonably priced Midday Snacks menu between lunch and dinner, and that's when we came. We loved the smoked trout dip with house potato chips. They have a very creative specialty drink menu and an excellent selection of local draft beers. I ordered the Bourbon Mule, and my wife ordered the cocktail of the day, a Sparkling Orange (made with gin, orange liqueur, fresh blood orange juice, lime, and sparkling wine). Both were bursting with flavor. I'm not a vegetarian, but I ordered the avocado sandwich, which was not only quite satisfying, but abundant with colors and flavors. My wife ordered the Caesar salad, with extra anchovies and tender grilled chicken. Surprisingly, we were at this point full enough for dessert. The peanut butter ice cream was light and unique, and the orange fennel cookie was both crispy and chewy. It was so good that I ordered another one, to go with the surprisingly tasty decaf blend.

    ",Clay Pit,"Came to clay pit for a friday lunch. they have their own parking lot but it was all full. Had to loop around twice until I finally found street parking. Coming inside, the restaurant wasn't too busy and the decor/ambience was great. ,The buffet is $9.50 and had a great array of choices. They bring out free naan bread btw! My favorite is the tikka masala. The mango kheer was okay - it is like a mango rice pudding. ,Our server was WONDERFUL though. He filled our water before we even knew to ask him. Was very nice and provided great service. ,Will try to come for Sunday lunch buffet - heard there are more options and better dessert (mango pudding!),Came to clay pit for a friday lunch. they have their own parking lot but it was all full. Had to loop around twice until I finally found street parking. Coming inside, the restaurant wasn't too busy and the decor/ambience was great. ,The buffet is $9.50 and had a great array of choices.

The space is very nice - quite large, and even has a patio (although the chairs were locked up). They have  pretty good cocktail list, as well as the Indian favorites such as mango lassi.,The food itself, however, was relatively bland. We ordered the baingan bharatha (eggplant), which unfortunately tasted like canned tomato sauce with some thawed eggplant and peas mixed in. The jeera saag that we got with paneer was tastier, but even though we picked 'spicy' it was still very very mild. The naans came out a cold, and were a bit chewy, and the rice we got was definitely under cooked for basmati rice.,The service was also very slow and poor. We ordered an appetizer when we had ordered our drinks, and when our waiter came to bring us our main entrees, he says 'Let me go check on the started...' At that point we were too frustrated, having already asked once about our starter, that we cancelled it. The least we expected was some sort of apology from the waiter, but he seemed unfazed.,Overall, probably wouldn't return here, despite the prime location.,Stopped by on a Wednesday night during the summer, looking for some good Indian food for dinner.

We could speculate we would be better off going for the lunch service and avoiding the dinner service, that key staff member(s) have left and that perhaps costs are trying to be controlled by using less ingredients and preparing dishes in large batches intending for them to last for days.

We had a party of 2 and were seated immediately. The restaurant is quite large and has a decent amount of seating (which would be good for larger groups). ,I ordered the vegetable korma and we also got the garlic and rosemary naan to share. The food was pretty good. The curry was creamy and tasted slightly sweet (I got mild spicy).  It paired well with the rice. My only complaint is I wish there were more vegetables. The naan was okay. I'm not a huge fan of garlic and it had some chunks if garlic on it. ,The service was good. The waiter was very good about coming around to check on us all the time to make sure everything tasted good. We got our food in a pretty timely manner. ,Overall I would definitely come back again, especially since it's probably the best Indian food within walking distance of campus.

They have a really nice decor inside and has good amount of seating. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table along with a chair paneer tikka and potato appetizer. The paneer tikka tasted like usual paneer capsicum sabzi and it didn't taste like tikka. ,For the main course we tried the dal makhni, malai kofta, vegetarian curry ( spice level desi hot for all) along with garlic & basil naan. My only complaint is that the desi hot was so spicy that it overshadowed over the taste of all curries we ordered. Nobody in India makes this spicy for the gravy that you can't taste the actual flavor of other spices. In addition, they had added jalapeño in dal and paneer which is not traditional Indian way to cook. I think they just added it to make it so much more spicier. ,When I was ordering desi hot, I thought it would be similar to what usual Indian restaurants serve in accordance with spice level of Indian food. You don't make it so much spicy that it destroys the flavor of curry all together. ,So for me I couldn't taste anything in any of the gravy except spicy flavor and hence I would recommend ordering medium for the spice level.,We were craving for Indian food in Austin, so we decided to give this restaurant a try. They have a really nice decor inside and has good amount of seating. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table along with a chair paneer tikka and potato appetizer.

We made sure to eat really fast (like, in 15 minutes) because we didn't want them waiting too long! Be warned: there's not much parking in the day time so you have to find street parking. ,The lunch buffet is SO worth it. It was only about $10 or so without tip. The options are limited but the food was extremely flavorful. If there's anything i recommend, DEFINITELY check out their soups. I had their celery soup and had myself going back for seconds and thirds. I still dream about it sometimes.,They have vegetarian and meat options so there is something that you are sure to like. This is the most popular Indian buffet in Austin and is worth much more in value than Teiji's down the road.

They give good portions, the food is always flavorful, and they have phenomenal naan bread. Their butter chicken and Mughali chicken are our favorite dishes on the menu. We also recently tried their calamari as an appetizer and were very pleased. It is definitely over priced though and always crowded. It is also hard to find parking on busy nights. Try to come early.,Very good Indian food. They give good portions, the food is always flavorful, and they have phenomenal naan bread.

    ",,"One of my favorites in Austin-- no lie! We came in for an early dinner (about 3:30pm) on Mother's Day. I came with my 2 yr old and my husband. Our server, Terrence, was super friendly and attentive.,The one thing we always get, without fail, are the Chicken Nachitos. I have never experienced nacho heaven like this before. They don't have your typical ingredients, but instead pickled peppers and carrots, cotija cheese (white Mexican cheese), black beans and shredded chicken. I feel like I could eat the whole thing as a meal but we always get it as an appetizer.,This last time I also tried the Ruby Grilled Trout. It had great flavor- but I am not a huge fan of wilted spinach. I still enjoyed it though. I was actually too full to eat it all after the Nachitos so I took it home (and forgot to snap a picture).,My absolute go to in the past has been the fish tacos and I can say after this visit that I will probably stick with the fish tacos. The serving size is always perfect and the beans and rice, as well as the tacos are amazing! I'm getting hungry again just writing this review.,One of my favorites in Austin-- no lie!

They say the mind is the second thing to go, so here goes. ,On a recent sortie to JAs for a Friday HH my buddy and I camped out at the bar to catch up and enjoy a few beers. As usual, service was great even as they got busier. Note, this is the go-to spot for the WestLakies so there is a wait during peak times and even at lunch some days.,I've enjoyed plenty of lunches and dinners here and have never been disappointed. I really enjoy their small plate Apps as they are easy to split. On this visit, we split the barbacoa tacos and they were a perfect compliment to our Thirsty Goat drafts. They usually have a few good local beers on draft and their full bar has some interesting options like Koopers and Whistle Pig if you are going the Manhattan route. We were tempted but cooler heads prevailed. ,JAs on 360 is a cool option for a few cocktails or a full meal and will always be in my go-to rotation.,I thought I had already provided a review of JAs on 360 as I have frequented this location a number of times.

Feeling a little sandwichy? Order up the steak with perfectly toasted fresh bread and prime cut amply stacker nestled among their flour dusted French fries. Top off your jammin culinary experience by having the fabulous chocolate mousse and cake surrounded with raspberry purée and expresso only if your mind can handle it, perfect ganache draped over a  magical ball that will predict that you WILL return.,Farm to table fresh, this is the real deal, loved their dishes so much that I returned the next day;) Chile mango shrimp served unusually with separate dish with cute little corn tortillas, accompanied by banging black beans and fluffy rice adorned with corn, pico de Gallo.

Arriving late, the servers will still happy to accommodate us because we had a reservation and were very friendly and helpful. We were hungry so we decided to get the queso and chips which were quite good, but nothing special (I think Kirby's is better),They recommended we get the enchiladas and a chicken fried steak, which was just what we did. The portions were extremely generous, and the gravy on both dishes was simply amazing. I was very impressed with the how much of the steak they gave us, and that it tasted very tender and juicy as well.,To topi things off, they gave us a free choice of dessert on the house for the birthday.  We chose to get a chocolate pecan pie topped with ice cream. Can't really go wrong with that choice. Simply delic. ,Wouldn't mind coming back here again, this is American Diner food done at a high level.,Came here to celebrate a birthday after hearing some good things!

This review only really applies to this salad because it's all I ever order. We get it to go on a weekly basis because my husband works nearby and we have a newborn. Would be five stars hands down based on how delicious it is, but the one problem is it comes deconstructed and not cut up, which is a bit of a pain in the a$$ (especially with said newborn). We now ask for the romaine chopped and that makes it world's easier than trying to cut it with a plastic knife and fork. Of course we could get out the cutting board and do it easily ourselves with a chefs knife but seems kind of silly when ordering take out to have to do extra work and dishes. I'd actually appreciate the chicken coming cut up as well, but just the romaine makes it doable and I hate to have to ask for modifications...I'd much rather it just come with the work done for us. Bottomline - 5 stars for the lovely people who are willing to accommodate our requests and for the delicious flavor. -1 for whoever decided it should come the way it does.,I am OBSESSED with the Caesar salad here.

He offered us dessert, next round of drinks, or an appetizer on the house. We got the guacamole which was great!

I had a steak, don't remember the exact name but I've provided a picture of it with this review. The steak had more fat than I would prefer but the meat was good. It came with mashed potatoes which tasted interesting. Almost like there was wasabi mixed in the mashed potatoes. The green beans and sauce was great. For dessert, the restaurant provided a birthday ice cream pie. That was delicious and a great way to wrap my sister's birthday dinner. ,Overall the experience was good and everyone enjoyed it.,So came in town for work and decided to eat dinner here with some coworkers. Now I lived here back in 09-11 and the location on 71 was amazing, service and food. This location, not so much. I mean the kid was okay he tried to make up for his service by giving a free dessert but we don't care about free stuff, we want good service, the same service my company gives my clients. But we got the quail which was decent, then ordered a ny strip med rare, came out medium well. I just wasn't please with the experience. I think the waiters need to be trained a bit more and the cooks need to be sat down and shown how to properly cook a steak. I'm sure I'll be back in town for work but I'll stick to the 71 location.,So came in town for work and decided to eat dinner here with some coworkers.

We had a group of 6 get together for Sunday brunch around 12:30pm. We were immediately seated in the outdoor patio area on a beautiful sunny day, which already started my experience on the right path. Our server immediately greeted us and took our drink orders before we walked over to the buffet table. I wasn't able to get a picture of the buffet setup, but I remember trying the Corn and Shrimp Salad, Grilled Vegetables, Chicken Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Pork Tenderloin, Green Chile Pork and Eggs, Jalapeño Sausage and yogurt and munchkins for dessert. Everything was delicious, but the Corn and Shrimp Salad was my favorite part of the main meal. I wish I could point out what salad dressing was used but I loved the use of seafood in the salad. The munchkins were amazing as well. I've never heard of Round Rock Donuts before, but I loved their twist on the glazed flavor. ,I wish we had this place up in the NJ/NY area, but I will definitely be back during my next trip to Austin!,Not a fan of buffets, but if I were to go to one again, this would be at the top of the list.

I not only thoroughly enjoyed the food, I enjoyed the service and the location of this particular restaurant. Our wait was 30 minutes, but ended up taking about 20 minutes. I really loved how there were shops within walking distance to waste time while you're waiting to be seated. We got a couple of drinks, which were only beers, but my husband and I both ordered a specialty pizza and they were both delicious! I got the spinach and mushroom vegan and gluten-free pizza, and he got the margarita pizza (GF). We also decided to get a vegetable tomato soup, and I don't really like tomatoes but I love the soup! It was their soup of the day, or week?,Only complaint on his pizza was that he wished there were mozzarella balls on top like typical margarita pizzas have. It was a little pricey for our taste, but if you're looking to splurge and get wholesome food, I definitely recommend this place!

The food is fresh with lots of veggie options and the restaurants are airy and clean. The not so good is that the place is typically busy so there can be a sizable wait time to get a table. ,We came to this True Food Kitchen on a very busy, rainy Saturday night. No reservations so we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. There were plenty of empty tables (easily 10 or more) but we were told that they were reserved. Frustrating to stand by an empty table for 40 minutes to eventually be sat there when the host decided that it was going to be a no-show. ,Once we sat down, the waiter came right over and took our order. Waited, again, for long time for the meal. The appetizers (soup and salad) came with the meal. Oh well. ,Food was good, as expected. I would definitely reconsider going here without a reservation. ,FYI: although I didn't see it mentioned anywhere, it looked like a dog-friendly restaurant.,DOG FRIENDLY,The nice thing about True Food Kitchen is consistency.

The service was SO SLOW that the manager actually came out and apologized to our table for the wait. It took forever to get our appetizer for the table and then even longer to get our actual meals. The food itself was great but most of the items on the menu were fairly pricey.

Our favorite steakhouse is closed on Sundays, so we all decided to visit Roaring Fork since none of us had eaten there, but heard good things about it. We all agreed our meals were good, but not great. ,First off, they brought out my side way before my meal or any one else's meal, usually it's all brought out at together. Secondly, my steak was way under done and had to be sent back. So everyone waited while my steak was cooked to order. Thirdly, the wait staff was just okay, we are used to a much more attentive and joyful waiter.,Lastly, parking is a kind of a hassle if you have never been here before. We did not know that they share valet service with the hotel, which is $13.00. So we ended up parking in the parking garage on the corner that is on Brazos and 7th, which is CC only, but it was only $8.00.

We loved this place!:) ,Thanks for a great final dinner Foster!,Ok Yelp, you're awesome and all but let's be realistic - this place is not a $$ restaurant. It's definitely a $$$ one. Was it worth it? Hell yeah. ,We went to the Roaring Fork for the last dinner before the end of our trip. I was on the hunt to find a casual steakhouse downtown - (you know, with the moose heads on the wall and the crushed peanuts on the ground?) and Roaring Fork was the best I could come up with. Is it casual? Kinda/not really - people were pretty well dressed at this establishment but we were still welcomed and treated well nonetheless. ,I started off with the lamb chop fondue appetizer - it came with a mini cauldron of delicious cheese and 3 beautifully lollipop trimmed lamb chops. There were also some cubes of bread that you could dip in the cheese too which was awesome.,We also got chips and guacamole for the table, a little steep at $9 but it was ok. They also gave us some little bites of jalapeño cornbread which was awesome. ,4/5 of us ordered the bone in ribeye - 28 days wet aged. Needless to say, WOW. What an amazing steak - absolutely perfectly cooked. I wouldn't change anything about it. Perfectly seasoned. $46 but worth every penny. Everyone at the table loved it. (We just ate at III Forks a couple days prior for a LOT more money just to only have an ""ok"" steak.) ,The entire dinner service from beginning to end was amazing. The friendly wait staff was never more than a few feet away. The only minor bit of disappointment I had was that this was only a $$ rated restaurant when clearly it should be a $$$. It's definitely worth every penny though. I did put in a request for Yelp to change that but we will see what happens. ,If I were to do it again - skip the guac, get the lamb fondue and order the bone in ribeye rare +. Awesome. I did get feedback from my friend that the tortilla soup is extremely salty and a huge portion. This seems to be consistent with what other Yelpers are saying, so maybe steer clear of the tortilla soup as well. Put on your fancy pants and have a great meal at the restaurant! I'll definitely come back.,Ok Yelp, you're awesome and all but let's be realistic - this place is not a $$ restaurant. It's definitely a $$$ one. Was it worth it? Hell yeah. ,We went to the Roaring Fork for the last dinner before the end of our trip. I was on the hunt to find a casual steakhouse downtown - (you know, with the moose heads on the wall and the crushed peanuts on the ground?) and Roaring Fork was the best I could come up with. Is it casual? Kinda/not really - people were pretty well dressed at this establishment but we were still welcomed and treated well nonetheless. ,I started off with the lamb chop fondue appetizer - it came with a mini cauldron of delicious cheese and 3 beautifully lollipop trimmed lamb chops. There were also some cubes of bread that you could dip in the cheese too which was awesome.,We also got chips and guacamole for the table, a little steep at $9 but it was ok. They also gave us some little bites of jalapeño cornbread which was awesome. ,4/5 of us ordered the bone in ribeye - 28 days wet aged. Needless to say, WOW. What an amazing steak - absolutely perfectly cooked. I wouldn't change anything about it. Perfectly seasoned. $46 but worth every penny. Everyone at the table loved it. (We just ate at III Forks a couple days prior for a LOT more money just to only have an ""ok"" steak.) ,The entire dinner service from beginning to end was amazing.

My girl and I ordered the fries with étouffée, small wedge salad, a ban mi sandwich and the Cubano.  Wedge was really on point. A small stacked affair with little piles of all your favorite goodies to be eaten like a taco or lettuce wrap. Fries themselves were good and of a very large size. But the sauce lacked any kind of brightness. We asked for hot sauce, a no go and then salt to bring it up. The sandwiches were both lacking in flavor and sloppy assembly. The pickles that came on the side of both were way salty and not worth a second bite. ,Service was hit and miss. Greater and offered us water for the dog right away. (Great host) server seemed to have limited knowledge of menu or beers.  ,Manager stopped by and asked how it was over his shoulder and I asked if he really wanted to know.

We had three of the appetizers, boudin balls, crawfish fries and the shishito peppers. They were all excellent!  We all tried various lunch entrees and everyone was pleased with what they ordered. I personally had the Fattoush salad. It was good, nothing exceptional, but good. Our server kept our glasses full, which is always nice. I highly recommend checking this place out for something different than your typical eatery.,Really great food and exceptional service. There were five of us that ate there today for lunch.

If you've ever been to Revelry on the East side, Revelry on the Boulevard is very similar- a lot of fun with great drink selections and tasty eats! We live in the Crestview neighborhood which is about a mile from Revelry on the Boulevard and it's easily one of the best spots in this area! It's located a few minutes past The Triangle on North Lamar and has ample parking and multiple patios. It really is a gem amongst limited options on that part of Lamar and is a great place to go out to dinner or just play some Jenga and drink beer after work.,We went for dinner and drinks with some neighborhood friends and got 3 apps, 4 meals, and 6 drinks. (That seems like a ton when you put it in writing!!!! Lol) It was all easily 5 stars- diverse options that were all tasty. We got the Brussels, shishito peppers (yum!), and wings, and then 2 of their sandwiches and a salad and the fish burger. So we got a wide spread and ate it all up! (No shame!),We will definitely be back to try their peanut butter cup dessert and to start our next Sunday Funday there! Give it a try!,This spot is awesome!

My wife and I stopped in and sat at the bar last night. Service was fantastic at the bar, with two bartenders helping us as well as Xavier (not certain of the spelling) who is the GM of this location. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming and the space is great. There were a ton of outdoor tables to choose from on the back, a massive bar inside, a selection of 2 to 6 top tables inside and a smaller patio facing Lamar. Options abound regardless the size and preference of your party.,Now to the really good stuff: the cocktails were STELLAR, fresh and very well-conceived. The draft cocktails were delicious and the draft beer selection was really good. The draft beer leans really heavily on local brews and had a great variety of styles. Off of happy hour, they are priced right with most being in the $6 range for a pint. We also noticed that the bar really seemed to be optimized for efficiency in a way that will allow them to keep up with the drinking needs of patrons even if they have a full-house. We tried the Paloma, On the Boulevardier and @thepupsofrevelry. We truly loved all three. Very cool note: $1 of every @thepups drink goes to Austin Animal Center. As a dog lover and puppy parent, this is the kind of thing I love to see. Bonus: it's a delicious drink that is going to be perfect for the long Austin summer.,Finally the food! We had Boudin Balls, Fried Brussel Sprouts, and etouffee fries. All were delicious. My wife proclaimed the brussels with candied walnuts and togorashi her favorite in town. I could have made a meal out of the etouffee fries. The dish was lightly battered fries topped with a crawfish and (I think) hatch chili etouffee sauce. Holy crap was this an indulgent, delicious treat. Then, since Thursday is buy one burger get one 1/2 off, we had the akaushi and veggie burgers. The akaushi was cooked a perfect medium as requested. We had them as listed on the menu with no additions and they were really great. As a carnivore, I was blown away by the taste and texture of the Beyond Meat patty on the ,veggie burger. I can't wait to go back to try some of the other sammies.,Finally, though already way too full, we finished with the coconut cream pie. If you like coconut, this is a must try. The shortbread crust and toasted coconut topping really pushes this over the edge. This is one of my favorite desserts in town. Its great without being overly sweet. All-told, this place knocked it out of the park, despite only having been open for a month. I can not wait to spend many more nights and many more dollars in this awesome restaurant.,This is one of the easiest 5-stars I've given in a while!

I can see that it's a great place to gather with friends and hang out for some cocktails. Also, the staff was very nice and attentive.,Cons: The food was ok. I had the fish sandwich, which was actually pretty good (no complaints), but it ONLY comes with kettle chips, which tasted stale not good at all. My friend said the same about the chips. I was extremely disappointed that there wasn't an option to sub any sides, like fries, even for a small upcharge. Instead, you had to order a separate large order of fries, which we ended up doing. I also ordered a half kale salad, which ended up being so drenched in dressing that I couldn't eat it. ,I understand that this place is new and hopefully these are issues that will be resolved over time; however, my entire group agreed that it wasn't someplace we would necessarily go back to...Austin has too many other great places.,This place was ok, but honestly I was not overly impressed.,Pros: The atmosphere was really chill and good.

I was extremely disappointed that there wasn't an option to sub any sides, like fries, even for a small upcharge. Instead, you had to order a separate large order of fries, which we ended up doing. I also ordered a half kale salad, which ended up being so drenched in dressing that I couldn't eat it. ,I understand that this place is new and hopefully these are issues that will be resolved over time; however, my entire group agreed that it wasn't someplace we would necessarily go back to...Austin has too many other great places.,This place was ok, but honestly I was not overly impressed.,Pros: The atmosphere was really chill and good.

My girlfriend & I have been looking for a pet friendly spot close to the house to watch games and we were more than pleasantly surprised to find this gem. ,The front of the restaurant is a bit deceiving. The place, while not huge, is much larger than it originally suggests. There's a huge parking lot around back and the back covered patio is very well done. Bar games, TVs and dog bowls for our furry friend - what else can you ask for? ,Since we didn't during lunch, we both opted for the lunch special of 1/2 a sandwich and side salad. I went with the pork belly banh mi and my gf had the blackened fish sandwich, both pairing it with the kale Caesar. The banh mi was perfectly seared & tasty pork belly on a fresh, crispy French roll. The kale Caesar was light, fresh and had the perfect amount of dressing. The blackened redfish sandwich was large with two nicely sized portions of grilled redfish with a corn salsa and delicious jalapeño aioli. We washed down the tasty little lunch with a couple cocktails: the ride or die & a lavender daiquiri. Both were made extremely well with just the right balance and neither overly sweet.,The service was prompt, polite and friendly. We will definitely be coming back, a lot!,THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!

From the moment we walked up, we were greeted with such warmth. Met our friends who were seated at the bar, ordered amazing cocktails and Shishito Peppers, which was probably the BEST appetizer I have ever had in my life. Beautiful, blistered, perfectly cooked and seasoned with just the right amount of smoke and sweet and salt,  and this creamy tangy mustardy dipping sauce. Then, Sriracha honey chicken wings that made me lose all concern for the cleanliness of my face. ,We moved to a table like respectable adults and ordered pretty much ALL the appetizers, plus the Cuban and Bon Mi sandwiches, which our waitress politely suggested might be too much, which I really appreciated, but we followed through anyways. The Brussels Sprouts, were like balsamic glazed walnut kissed Heaven. The sandwiches, which the kitchen so thoughtfully cut into 4 separate segments with their own dipping sauces and delicious pickled everything, were absolutely perfect. I would go back just for that Cuban sandwich. But honestly, it was the overall experience, the laid back but beautiful ambiance, the personable staff, the bathrooms that smelled like designer perfume. EVERYTHING. Plus the wonderful company I was able to share it all with. I can't wait to come back to Revelry, and bring all of my friends that appreciate quality things.,This place is incredible!!!

And the cornbread was massive but also dry. ,The meats: the brisket was IT, and get the fatty cut not the lean it doesn't taste fatty it's just more juicy and tender.

While this place isn't the same as waiting for hours for a place to open or waiting out in the sun by a food truck, there is something rustic and classic I love about TB. The simplistic cafeteria style brings me back to an environment that is very comfortable. I love the way the drinks are all lined up in the ice, ready for the taking. ,Let's not forget how great the actual food is. Starting with the sides, I love the green beans and mac & cheese. They rock. Follow those up with a banana pudding, and it is time to grab some meat. I always over-order here. Oh well. The Beef rib is pricey,  but fabulous. My staple is 1/4 pound brisket, 1/4 turkey, and a jalapeno cheddar sausage link. I always recommend to eat turkey and white meat chicken first, or else they seem to dry out. ,Finally, to the condiments, sauces, and drinks. These are a must: slice of white bread, side of pickles and onions, and a sweet tea. I like that tables aren't supposed to be reserved. It makes the flow much better for everyone in line. ,Overall, I love bringing guests who want good Texas BBQ but don't want to wait in a huge, hot line.,Terry Blacks is very close to my apartment.

Hands down worth the wait. ,Went for dinner on a Friday and of course there was already a line but got lucky and it probably took around 30mins. ,If you have a large group, ordering family style is a good choice. More options and more sides. ,The brisket was sooooo good and tender but also breaks apart so easily when you cut into it with just plastic utensils. Would recommend getting brisket if you had one choice of all the meats to get. Beef rib and sausage was also good. Probably any meat here. ,Of all the sides, mac n cheese hit the spot. Creamy cheesy and perfect. The other sides like cole slaw, cream corn, and green beans were also good. The more sides, the merrier. ,Tables clear up quite consistently to the rate of people getting their orders so getting seated won't be too hard as well. And compared to other bbq joints, Terry Black's has the most efficient set up to get your orders out asap.,I mean, come on!,Cafeteria style bbq joint in Austin. Had to trust my fellow yelpers here to find the best bbq in town and they did not lead me astray. ,The line was out the door, but luckily they have a window where they serve drinks, so the heat was actually bearable with ice cold beers keeping our party busy while we waited. ,In retrospect it would have been smarter if we ordered family style instead of individually, because we all ordered way way way too much; too much meat, too many sides. Probably could have saved some money getting larger sized sides instead of the individual portions. ,Regardless, the food is here delicious! My friend got the last beef rib of the day, which was really delicious. Their brisket is top notch. And their sausage was very good as well.,I mean, come on!,Cafeteria style bbq joint in Austin.

We were lucky enough to snag a parking spot in their private lot. But, for the amount of people frequenting this spot, their lot was quite small. There was a line of people out the door as well. Although, it seemed as if it was moving at a decent pace. Before even entering the restaurant, we ordered some sparkling water at the walk up counter to quench our thirst in this heat. ,Inside, we passed through a display of their bbq sauce and rub products that were available for purchase to take home. Then, we came to their a la carte sides station. We ordered two pints of their mac and cheese and two of their banana pudding desserts. Finally, we ordered one beef rib and 1/3 of a pound of jalapeño cheese sausage at their meats station.,We weren't able to find a table inside as it was packed. So, we proceeded to find a table outside, where there were fans to somehow help with the heat. Although, it was still sweltering hot. There was a cooler with ice that contained their bbq sauces: original, spicy, and sweet. To be honest, their sauces were too sweet for our liking. We only tried the original and spicy. We didn't even bother to try their sweet sauce. The spicy sauce was the better of the two sauces, with a tangy, mustardy taste. But, it wasn't spicy at all. I prefer Rudy's spicy, peppery, and tangy bbq sauce. ,As far as their meats go, their beef rib was rich. The meat was soft enough and fell off the bone. It was a good beef rib, but it wasn't the best we've had. We did appreciate the outer parts of the rib that tasted peppery and almost like beef jerky. Their jalapeño cheese sausage was good, but it wasn't great. The cheese didn't add much umph, in our opinion. Rudy's jalapeño sausage was better. ,Their mac and cheese was creamy and rich, but surprisingly bland. We added a ton of black pepper, salt, and spicy bbq sauce to bring out the flavor. But, these didn't help it very much. We also ordered too much because we were ordering with our stomachs, not our eyes. Lol. One pint of mac and cheese would've been enough to feed 2 (even 3) people. We ordered two pints and regretted it later. Safe to say, we still won't be ordering the mac and cheese again because it just lacked flavor. However, their banana pudding was the best thing we ate here. It's definitely made from scratch. It had light and creamy layers of custard, softened Nilla wafers, whipped cream, and ripe bananas. They added a crispy Nilla wafer on top for a slight contrast in texture. It was pure heaven. If we ever visit this spot again, we will unapologetically order just this dessert. ,In short, if you like sweet bbq sauces, this might be your go to spot. We haven't tried all their meats and sides. So, there may be something that might be excellent here that we missed. But, we would definitely give a strong thumbs up for their banana pudding.

First order starts with sides. I highly recommend the creamed corn and cornbread as the standouts. The rest are all good but nothing memorable.  ,Next up is your choice of meat. Got the brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs and sausage. It was all great! The tenderness and pull of the brisket were spot on. The beef ribs fell of the bone and was super juicy. The pork ribs were well sauced and also off the bone tender. The sausage had a great smoky flavor. My one issue was that the rubs were a bit on the salty side for the brisket and beef ribs.,Good luck with parking.  It can get tricky.  ,No question this place is 5 stars.

I felt like I was eating something out of Bedrock (the Flintstones). The food was moist and good to the last bite. It weren't cheap, though. The meal set us back more than $35 each but I must say it was worth it. Ignore how long the line is - we waited 38 minutes and we could feel the authenticity as we anticipated our feast. Crying out loud, get a long neck ice cold beer in line from the exterior bar counter while you wait, ok, make it two to get in to the place. I repeat, they may sell out of items so if you have your heart on brisket... don't throw a fit.,Definitely would come back again. Loved the food and the charming southern decor of worn-in cowboy boots, cacti, and red-checkered table cloths are ever-present and brings a feeling of ""home at last"" to anyone who enters.

I got the brisket sandwich and Oh my it was loaded! It was filled with brisket goodness! The creamed corn was amazing! I had a taste of my husband's Mac n cheese and it was great! We went and got the peach cobbler and it was a home run! We were pleased with our experience and definitely say it is one of the best BBQ places I have been to.,So this is supposed to be one of THE places in Austin for BBQ, and my cousin told me there's a whole feud among various Black family members about who owns the original or something, but if I had to base my review on nothing but brisket and sauce they'd get an F. Brisket was so dry is was inedible without sauce, but the sauce tasted gross to me. Luckily we got a beef rib to share and each a pork rib so we had plenty of edible food, and neither type of rib requires sauce because both hold up without. The mac n cheese was also yummy - creamy and homemade tasting. I was surprised how many people came through while we were there - we arrived just after 3 on a Monday and left around 5 (it was raining and we were waiting it out before walking to our next destination) and the place was never empty.,So this is supposed to be one of THE places in Austin for BBQ, and my cousin told me there's a whole feud among various Black family members about who owns the original or something, but if I had to base my review on nothing but brisket and sauce they'd get an F.

When we arrived the line was out the door and to the sidewalk! Which is good sign of how good the food is- thinking positively! Luckily the line moved quick! ,The food: The ribs were tender and had great taste! But very fatty. The peach cobbler, cream corn, Mac and cheese were all pretty good/average. The beans I expected to have that baked bbq bean flavor but it had more of a regular chili flavor? Now the corn bread is where I have my final judgement. I was told they had the best corn bread.

I would definitely re-order the ribs and brisket, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the sausage (not a huge fan of cheese in my seiners). ,To be completely honest, I thought the sides were the superstars of the meal.

Not sure his language or how he approached the bartender, he had been mostly ordering at the bar and not at the table.

I was told that I was drunk after one drink on my birthday, surrounded by family and friends. I was not pregaming or anything mind you. Humiliating, utterly humiliating and bizarre to say the least. I was so upset I could not eat my meal. In fact, I didn't even want the leftovers because the energy was so bad and those shrimp and grits were nothing to write home about. I had planned on revealing important life news to my guests, opening gifts, sharing laughs and dessert, but we all basically bolted with half eaten plates or plates woofed down because they all wanted me to not be sitting there in tears.

I couldn't hear what my guests at the other end of the table had to say to this young man. Perhaps he is quite inexperienced in the fact that you don't let your biggest table leave appalled. I expressed that this was a ridiculous situation and got no more than a ""shrug."" Yup, that's it, a shrug and he walked away. No resolution, no explanation. To expedite getting the hell out of there a friend paid the whole bill and yes, gave 20% trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that their staff and team seems extremely inexperienced and how the manager was probably tired because he has to attend 8th grade and work.

The chicken reminded me more of KFC texture and Popeyes's spice level. Uhhh no thank you! That's my one and done!,Walked in with a party of 5 on a Friday evening. Waited in line for about 15 minutes before being seated.,OVERALL: 4.5 stars. The fried chicken was delicious, though the wait for the food was long, and the sides were mediocre. ,FOOD: I got the half-chicken, which consisted of a thigh, leg, breast, and two wings. Besides the chicken thigh (which was a bit dry), the rest of the chicken was tender and moist, with a flavor that wasn't too spicy but had a nice kick. The chicken skin was crispy yet light -- probably my favorite part. The sides weren't my favorite; while the coleslaw was good, the beans were way too sweet.,Notably, once we got seated, we had to wait a bit more than a half hour or so for our food to actually arrive. ,AMBIANCE/SERVICE: Service was friendly if a bit curt (probably because the place is very busy).,Walked in with a party of 5 on a Friday evening.

I was very well aware of that but no one ever came by so we were just awkwardly waiting there. ,We placed our orders with her, our drinks were quick but the food took a good 25 minutes or so.

The chicken was warm but not hot. The seasoning on it was great but I expected better tasting chicken with all the raving reviews.,Lots of flies flying around while you eat.

Gus's fried chicken is located in multiple states, but I specifically went to the one in Austin. When I went, there was really no line and I only waited about 5 minutes for my food. They are pretty quick. The chicken itself is pretty crispy without have a hard bite to it (if that makes sense lol). It also was a bit spicy, but also not overbearing. If you don't like spicy food, I believe you still would be able to handle and enjoy this place. The staff was also pretty friendly from the time I entered to the time I left. The only thing I wasnt over the moon with was the sides. I subbed mine for Mac and cheese and greens and thought they were just ok.

The breading was seasoned perfectly and wasn't overly spiced. You can tell that the food is made to order and they certainly let the chicken speak for itself and don't add a bunch of spices to it.,You get the option to choose one of their white or dark meat plate variations but can also select just the individual pieces itself. The fried okra was greatness and the the fries were perfectly salted but the macaroni was the sleeper side of the day. We're not normally one to get dessert after a meal, but we got a slice of their chess pie and it tasted very similar to buttermilk pie. The crust was the best part! It was flaky and  melted in your mouth with every bite! And if you're a sweet tea person, this is the place to get it!,Overall a delicious budget friendly restaurant that we'd definitely recommend!

    ",Koriente,"A vegetarian/pescatarian restaurant in Austin, sacrilege? Try again, Koriente deserves to stay after this epic meal!,I was a bit hesitant honestly even with all of the positive reviews on Yelp, but I figured I would give it a go. Upon arrival it almost has the vibes of a hole in the wall setup, dark, diner type seating, outdated. This should not take away from the epic-ness you will experience. When I arrived, the front hostess was quite cheery and provided a seat right away. She also explained that they offer unlimited free miso, which was a solid 4 out of 5! The menu is pretty easy to navigate and offers many tasty treats of full meals. It focuses on Asian fusion, whether Japanese, Korean, or some South East Asia meals. I had plans to grab an appetizer or two until I had two bowls of miso, oops! I went ahead and grabbed a bowl of Honey Glazed Mahi with an avocado and fried egg on top. Meal came out pretty quick and it looked great! You are guaranteed to not walk away hungry after ordering many of their bowls as they are packed with healthy ingredients that are quite filling. Price point was extremely approachable, coming in under $10, which is great. ,Short story short, make sure to add this wonderful restaurant to your go to list if visiting Austin as it is a must!,A vegetarian/pescatarian restaurant in Austin, sacrilege?

The portions here are decent as well but I had no trouble scarfing it down because it was delicious.,I ordered a pan seared ahi tuna bowl. Fore warning the sauce they give you is pretty spicy so go easy on it. I learned the hard way as I doused my entire bowl with it. The fish was cooked to my liking with some parts still rare and tender. I think you can customize this too. The ordering process is simple:you order at the front and they bring it to you.

From the Asian fusion menu, I was sort of expecting a ritzy, modern environment, but it's actually super casual, with self-serve miso soup and water--it almost feels like you're dining in someone's home, rather than a business, which is comforting. What compounds the homey atmosphere is the extremely friendly staff. I basically just went with the cashier's suggestions, a salmon noodle bowl, and even added an egg to my meal on the house! When I asked for it to-go he started considering out loud how to best package the meal given the sunny side up egg, etc., which was endearing, and I just decided to eat in. Maybe I'm just not used to Southern hospitality but the care definitely warmed my heart!  ,It feels like the entire restaurant is geared towards the very young Austin demographic since the food is also an easy one-bowl yet flavorful deal. My meal was essentially Korean japchae noodles topped with broccoli and salmon. The food tastes like what you would cook for yourself at home, in the good way. At the end of my meal when I was visibly looking around trying to determine whether I needed to bus my own table a staff member caught my eye and waved me off, in the ultra friendly Koriente way. The only slight con was that it was pretty dark in the restaurant, and I wasn't sure why all their blinds were drawn. Overall though, it's the perfect student eatery.

The hummus roll was great. It can fill you up if you don't share  ,It took a while to get our bowls so you know they were busy servicing everyone. You also get to have some miso soup if you'd like at no cost. ,I think the dishes were tasty but they certainly could use more spice to make it a bit more authentic. But overall I was happy about the quality of the food and the service. If I come around the area again, I'll definitely stop by again,Amazing place! Great place for lunch, especially if you're working at the capitol. Not too far away and convenient for cyclists since the parking here is super, super limited. I don't think I'd come here if I had to drive just because of the surrounding traffic and huge lack of parking. But if you get a Lyft or bike, it's super worth it. ,The food is so fresh, and the dishes are perfectly balanced with their flavors. It felt like more of a poke bowl than bimbambop (which is what it sounded like they were going for), but still tastes great! The entrées are filling and come with a soup and salad for lunch. It was nice to munch that on while waiting for the entree. The restaurant is so cute, and I loved the decor. I would definitely come here again!,Amazing place!

I would definitely come here again!,Maybe it's cause I grew up eating traditional Asian foods, but I'm always skeptical of Asian fusion restaurants because I feel like it won't taste as good as traditional cooking. While my skepticism might be true other places, this place proved me wrong. I had a great experience from the food to the workers to the reasonable prices. My girlfriend and I came here looking for a snack so we decided to split the garden hand roll with spicy tuna poke. For $11 in Austin it was a decent amount of food! ,The tuna for the spicy poke was just alright (I'm biased since I grew up in California), but the flavors were on point. Next time I'll stick to beef, chicken, or tofu. FYI, they have complementary, refillable miso soup which is always a plus. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious so I definitely need to come back here on an empty stomach.

Had a great conversation about the history of the restaurant and how it came to be. Now the food, it was amazing, I got the mix mix with spicy tuna poke and the shitaki tofu with a fried egg.

Wish they had more parking so it would be more convenient for those of us not on dirty 6th. Also, there are a lot of homeless and other wanderers around the area, so just be aware of your surroundings especially at night. ,I came here for a weeknight dinner with a friend. I ordered the Obake bowl B with the 'rice medallions' the disc rice cakes that other Korean restaurants put in their tteokguk soup. I personally love these things, so it was a perfect dish for me with a sweet beef, very similar to bulgogi. The dish also has broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms in it. Good proportions of everything and definitely very filling. You can also add an egg or avocado to your dish for  a little extra. I wasn't sure if avocado would really go with my dish but the guy at the register (pretty sure he's the owner) offered to give me both and just charge me for the egg. Agreed the egg is pretty good and avocado is too, but probably not needed.  ,The owner also recommended the mix mix bowl with salmon so I might try that next time.,Small place tucked away downtown.

The guy taking my order was super nice and added garlic, made it spicy, and gave me the egg on top for free.

Conveniently located near dirty 6th for going out after!,My coworker and I drove an hour north to get to Koriente, and did not regret it one bit! Parking was not too hard to find as there are ample street parking. However I would say be careful not to leave any valuables in the car as there are wanderers around. ,The two of us were deprived of somewhat Asian food, and therefore as we arrive at Koriente, we decided to order more than what we can finish so we can take some for the road next day. We ordered the smoked salmon roll and the Koriente pickles as starters, and shared the japchei, papaya salad, and the shiitake mushroom. Lemme tell you - it was a lot of food. ,To start with my least favorite, which is probably the easiest, would be the papaya salad. I don't think it was that special and the flavor was slightly off. However, I really liked the japchei and the smoked salmon roll. The smoked salmon roll is wrapped in rice paper, like the wrap used in Vietnamese spring rolls. I really liked the mix of texture (crunch with the veggies and soft with the wrap and the salmon). The Japchei was not too oily like some places can be. I also liked that here at Koriente you can substitute rice with japchei, it makes the meal that much better! Not to mention the Koriente pickles tasted very much like the side dishes you'd get at an authentic Korean restaurant!,All in all, I had a great experience here at Koriente.

Tons of vegetarian options, I'm not used to having so many options and not knowing what to order. I finally chose the rice medallion sauté (I asked for it spicy, with tofu and broccoli added).

And bird bird is now officially one of those places.,Thoughts: the food is comforting and delicious. It's the food you think you'll get at a mom and pop diner but presented in a hip manor road sort of way. The food here tastes like the owners tried really hard to make everything perfect before opening. I've tried pretty much everything on their menu. But I know for certain the queen beak and the dough doughs are a must every visit. Pricing is fair because you're getting a novelty item imo and there truly isn't a place that does it better in town. ,Overall, the staff is great, the food is great, and you won't break bank eating here, there's no reason not to give 5 stars. If you're afraid of crowds go after 1:30 or 2 pm on the weekends.,So I'm finally getting around to reviewing bird bird biscuit despite eating it many times.

There are seats inside and outside but it may be hard to get one during their peak hours. Parking is just street parking and is pretty easy to find. Although the line may be long, service is quick so do not let that deter you! ,Now onto the biscuits!! They are made fresh and to perfection. It is filling but not too heavy. The biscuit itself is buttery, light, fluffy, yet still holds it shape. ,I've had the queen beak and the bird bacon biscuit. Queen beak is definitely the favorite - it has crispy fried chicken with a hint of spice and sweetness from the honey. The flavor is very well rounded! Chicken is cooked to perfection as well. Juicy, and tender yet the skin is fried to give the perfect crunch.  The bird bacon biscuit is another good option for breakfast lovers!!,The biscuits are thick and huge. Definitely worth the price. You will leave feeling very satisfied and your taste buds will thank you for giving it such a good treat !!,This place has the best biscuits I've ever had!

I,THE HYPE IS REAL YALL!!! Popped into this adorable and tiny establishment with only 1 door, so you can imagine the foot traffic is constantly flowing. We ordered the Queen Beak, little chick, and the anniversary birthday donut holes. I saw these massive pieces of fried chicken being put onto a biscuit and thought immediately, there is no way in hell I can eat that in one sitting. The cashier offered to cut it in half and save it for later. GENIUS! The Queen Beak is mouth-watering delicious. No joke!

We parked down the street in the neighborhood and could see the line wrap around the building on our way out. It definitely gets busy and is small inside so you may have to take it to-go (or sit on their curb outside... because who can wait the whole car ride home?). ,The queen beak is basically a spicy honey butter chicken biscuit that puts Whata to shame. The chicken thigh meat gives it the perfect amount of moisture and the sweetness of the honey blends soooo well with the spice of the mayo. The biscuit is done the same for all the sandwiches and all I can say is.. butter my butt and call me a biscuit! If I could just get a blanket of this stuff I would sleep great at night!! Pillowy and the right amount of that oh so tasty F A T. No regrets today. ,Also you've got to try the May special- I know there's only 5 days left of the month so it's not too late!!! The biscuits and gravy were not too heavy and the egg added some moisture. But what I liked the most was the pork and beef topping (not too salty but still a rich meat flavor) and the tomato/onion/salsa topping (gives a lil spice too if you're looking for a wake up call in your dish). Definitely not your average biscuits n gravy!! ,Overall, the food is 10/10 in my book and well worth the money - Basically everything is under $10 and I know tons of places in Austin that have comparable dishes for more $$ that aren't half this tasty!,Not sure how I never heard about this East Austin gem, but I will definitely be back!

During the explanation of how things work, I was told that the broth is basically just there to cook the meat and has little flavor. Boy were they right, and I'll be darned if my reaction to laugh at getting a broth described as essentially flavorless when you sit down would have been appropriate.,So then you have raw meat, which doesn't have flavor. You're left with the flavor coming from dips. Alright, so you get a ponzu sauce (which was a pretty good ponzu sauce!), a peanut sauce, and a truffle sauce which I'd summarize as soy sauce. So, all the flavor I got was from 3 sauces which I didn't really enjoy, and it didn't leave a diverse flavor profile. All I tasted was the dip. Once was enough for each of them - none of the flavors stood out to make me want to taste them multiple times. I do like how the vegetables retained a good amount of flavor due to us cooking it for an extended time.,Dining area is tiny, but that's not a big deal. Just wasn't comfortable. I'd have preferred a communal hot pot, but I do think that individual hot pots is a neat idea, though it is one that seems like a gimmick just to create an up-charge.,There were bits of wood from those cheap disposable skewers used on the hot pockets all over the inside the pot pocket so that was fun to spit out bits of wood while attempting to eat.,Watermelon dessert was fantastic.,Price per person essentially starts at $45.,Not impressed at the slightest.

Being a Tatsu-ya fan, I eagerly anticipated what they could do with the hot pot dining style, but not just hot pot, higher end style hot pot. Austin itself lacks a lot of higher tier restaurants so any with this style are welcome, but even with that standard did the Tatsu-ya guys deliver? Short answer, undoubtedly Yes!,First off I want to say that this is definitely a 'treat yourself' kind of place. The price reflects it, but with the experience you get and presentation and overall amount of options you get, this really worth it. Certainly best if you are interested in trying something more unusual than a typical dinner experience as well as looking to fill yourself.,With that said let's get into the restaurant!

You're first welcomed and given a nice little lavender oiled towel to prepare for your meal.,After seated you can order what type of broth you get which will be your hot pot you use to cook your food. Note that all food comes technically 'raw' but all food can be eaten raw or cooked! It's really up to the users liking. I ended going with the pork style broth since it's similar to their tatsuya ramen.,After you order a broth, you're then given the choice of what types of foods you want to cook, or to go Omakase style, which quite literally means in Japanese ""I'll leave it up to you"". I ended up going with the 'baller omakase', as I wanted to try the best the restaurant had to offer, also to try the elusive A5 meat.,All foods come out to you on small trays and you're given the utensils as well as instructions on how to cook them. Props to the staff for being extremely patient and so helpful with all options.,Part of the experience is getting to try to cook and experiment the cooking times for all the different kinds of meats/veggies. So the enjoyability is really up to the users choice. I will say the best one for me was again the A5 beef. Ohhhhh so smooth and buttery, I even ate some raw just to try it, best of all you actually get a certificate verifying the type of cow and how it was raised.,My personal experience I really enjoyed my time with DipDipDip. My main server Matt was just fantastic and very attentive and really brought a positive vibe to the experience. Other notable staff member, Jamie, also brought a lot of joy just seeing her interact well with other customers whom have never tried hot pot before.,Bottom line I will say a lot of the enjoyment of this place is up to the user since it's much more interactive than a typical dinner experience. Yes it can be pricey, but the user is free to invest as much as they want, it really depends on what they want.,I highly recommend a reservation as this place fills up quick!

We love popping in and out of Domo as well.  ,DipDipDip was a considerable letdown, but over time I think it will get better. My 2 stars are for the ambiance, decor, and presentation. The missing 3 stars are for the complete lack of flavor in the food, the price, and overall experience.  ,Walking up, you are enamored with the beautiful storefront (in a strip mall). It looks great, and there are drink menus and regular menus to check out while you wait. Similar to Kemuri, I think this is a great way to keep those waiting entertained.,Your full party must be present to be seated, standard. When it was our turn to go in, it was beautiful. The decor was amazing, and you expect to be in for a one of a kind experience that you will never forget. Pictures probably don't do this part of your experience justice.,Unless you have done shabu before, you may be slightly confused.  I used to do them when I lived in Queens, and even this menu threw me for a loop initially.  The waiter was friendly and explained the menu and process with the other two people in my group. We asked questions about the items and ultimately made our decisions. The menu is very red meat-heavy, and it wasn't until we asked that they let us know that there were seafood options.,The Tatsu-ya Omakase seemed like a safe bet, so that's what I ordered along with the Tonkotsu broth. In my group, the other two ordered a la carte also with the tonkotsu. We were forewarned that the broth would not taste anything like Ramen Tatsu-ya's tonkotsu broth but that it would be super flavorful as our shabu went on. In the group's a la carte order, they ordered meatballs, pot pockets, a couple gyozas, a meat, and the ranch dip (was plain old ranch). ,The broths were brought to the table immediately along with my omakase items and some complimentary vegetables. You also get 2 dips (ponzu and sesame gomadare) and a bowl of rice. The rice was sort of pointless because there is no room on the table or easy way to incorporate it into your meal. The vegetables were not even close to enough to share, and none that could produce any sort of flavor at all. Once the broth heated up, I tasted it to see what I needed to do to bring the flavor up and I knew immediately that I had a lot of work to do. The broth tasted completely flavorless (water has more flavor). ,I started to cook the meats and vegetables immediately and 30 minutes later, still no flavor. I asked the waiter for fresh garlic, onions, and either salt or soy sauce to enhance the flavors, and he looked at me completely baffled and said: ""We don't do that here, but it would be a good idea."" Odd... because all of the shabus I used to do in Flushing Queens gave you those types of things with your broth as soon as you sat down at no charge. A huge plate of vegetables usually comes with the broth, and as you and your group shabu in the same pot with flavorful items, you typically get a delicious broth in the end that you can then split and dip noodles into. ,Make sure you pay attention to what you ordered because, with everything going on, its easy to forget what you ordered, or what comes with your order. I never received the 'noodle of the day' that came with my omakase and then when I asked for the noodles, they were sold out and then charged me for the other noodle off the cart. Also, for my truffle sukiyaki, a waiter put it on our table with no explanation, so we had no idea what it was or what to do with it. ,They also forgot several a la carte items for my friends. When we brought this to their attention, they brought them towards the end of the shabu with little broth left (it evaporates over time) and then still charged them for the items. A quick note on the broth, as it evaporates, they will come by to top you off with more dashi, but that waters down any sort of flavor you built from the beginning of your shabu. They also brought an extra sausage to the table on accident. When we told the waiter that we didn't order it, he said ""it's on the house,"" but then charged us for the extra meat anyway. , ,In the end, I felt like we paid for ambiance and a unique experience.  Between three people, we spent a little over $300. I think that this place will get better over time, but perhaps they are trying too hard. Shabu shouldn't be this complex, confusing, or expensive. I wouldn't order an expensive piece of A5 Wagyu only to torch it in flavorless broth. You're better off ordering that elsewhere and having it properly cooked. Maybe I'll go back in a year or more once they've ironed out the kinks and get some seasonings. For now, I'll stick to Kemuri and Ramen Tatsu-ya.,Huge fan of the Tatsu-Ya brand. Ramen Tatsu-ya is great. Kemuri is one of my go-to spots when I have friends in town. We love popping in and out of Domo as well.  ,DipDipDip was a considerable letdown, but over time I think it will get better. My 2 stars are for the ambiance, decor, and presentation. The missing 3 stars are for the complete lack of flavor in the food, the price, and overall experience.  ,Walking up, you are enamored with the beautiful storefront (in a strip mall). It looks great, and there are drink menus and regular menus to check out while you wait. Similar to Kemuri, I think this is a great way to keep those waiting entertained.,Your full party must be present to be seated, standard. When it was our turn to go in, it was beautiful. The decor was amazing, and you expect to be in for a one of a kind experience that you will never forget. Pictures probably don't do this part of your experience justice.,Unless you have done shabu before, you may be slightly confused.  I used to do them when I lived in Queens, and even this menu threw me for a loop initially.  The waiter was friendly and explained the menu and process with the other two people in my group. We asked questions about the items and ultimately made our decisions. The menu is very red meat-heavy, and it wasn't until we asked that they let us know that there were seafood options.,The Tatsu-ya Omakase seemed like a safe bet, so that's what I ordered along with the Tonkotsu broth. In my group, the other two ordered a la carte also with the tonkotsu. We were forewarned that the broth would not taste anything like Ramen Tatsu-ya's tonkotsu broth but that it would be super flavorful as our shabu went on. In the group's a la carte order, they ordered meatballs, pot pockets, a couple gyozas, a meat, and the ranch dip (was plain old ranch). ,The broths were brought to the table immediately along with my omakase items and some complimentary vegetables. You also get 2 dips (ponzu and sesame gomadare) and a bowl of rice. The rice was sort of pointless because there is no room on the table or easy way to incorporate it into your meal. The vegetables were not even close to enough to share, and none that could produce any sort of flavor at all. Once the broth heated up, I tasted it to see what I needed to do to bring the flavor up and I knew immediately that I had a lot of work to do. The broth tasted completely flavorless (water has more flavor). ,I started to cook the meats and vegetables immediately and 30 minutes later, still no flavor. I asked the waiter for fresh garlic, onions, and either salt or soy sauce to enhance the flavors, and he looked at me completely baffled and said: ""We don't do that here, but it would be a good idea."" Odd... because all of the shabus I used to do in Flushing Queens gave you those types of things with your broth as soon as you sat down at no charge. A huge plate of vegetables usually comes with the broth, and as you and your group shabu in the same pot with flavorful items, you typically get a delicious broth in the end that you can then split and dip noodles into. ,Make sure you pay attention to what you ordered because, with everything going on, its easy to forget what you ordered, or what comes with your order. I never received the 'noodle of the day' that came with my omakase and then when I asked for the noodles, they were sold out and then charged me for the other noodle off the cart. Also, for my truffle sukiyaki, a waiter put it on our table with no explanation, so we had no idea what it was or what to do with it. ,They also forgot several a la carte items for my friends. When we brought this to their attention, they brought them towards the end of the shabu with little broth left (it evaporates over time) and then still charged them for the items.

Let me just say this, all of the hype is not true... it is even better!! From the moment that you walk in, and see this amazing new restaurant, to the phenomenal service that I received from Wynn (you have to ask for her!) oh and the food!!! It's a little much at first if you've never been to a Shabu Shabu restaurant... but you quickly get the hang of it. You pick your delicious broth, and your meats, etc. they also have a cart that has a la carte items like ramen and seafood. The scallop is a must try (eat it raw dipped in the ponzu sauce for 30 seconds) their food is truly life changing. I heard that it is for the most part by reservation only, with a 30 day waiting list.

Definitely my new favorite restaurant!!,Came here today to celebrate our fifth year anniversary with my boyfriend and we were so happy that we chose this place XD We made a reservation for 5:30 and after we arrived we waited outside for about 5 minutes before getting seated, during which we ordered the drinks and studied the menu. After we were seated, the server came immediately and explained how everything works in detail. ,We ordered a mixture of omakase and la carte. I had the soy broth and I really like it. It first formed a tofu skin after it started boiling, and you can take out the tofu skin and dip it in the ponzu sauce. So good XD In the end, the tofu inside my broth kinda coagulated and became tofu. I took them out and dipped it in the sesame sauce; also very delicious. My boyfriend's kunbu broth was just okay according to him. Not much flavor in it., Our favorite dish was the A5 wagyu beef. The server also suggested us eating it raw as they were freshly cut. I tried it raw and dipped it in the ponzu sauce; it went very well with it. You don't even need to bite it; it literally melted inside your month!!! The texture changed a bit after you shabu it for about 15 seconds. We tried it in the truffle egg dipping sauce and it went very well. ,Second must have dish is their homemade tofu. This was not on the menu but on their cart. So if you see it, definitely order it! You can have it raw or put it in the shabu for few minutes. We recommended to eat it raw. It was so silky with not a very strong soy flavor, which I really preferred. My boyfriend also put a bit of the sesame sauce on top of the tofu, genius action XD,After we finished everything. The server came again and asked for our experience for the day. They also served us with a complimentary watermelon dessert. That one was very refreshing XD Before having the dessert I felt so full, and after one bite into that ice watermelon dessert, I felt like I could eat a whole cow again XD,Really satisfied today. We will definitely come back soon :),Came here today to celebrate our fifth year anniversary with my boyfriend and we were so happy that we chose this place XD We made a reservation for 5:30 and after we arrived we waited outside for about 5 minutes before getting seated, during which we ordered the drinks and studied the menu.

We will definitely come back soon :),Made reservations (highly recommend) and went in the second day of opening. They call it a dining experience and it sure was. From beginning to end there was always something orchestrated.,Food: Firstly, the meats, dips, dessert, add ons, extras were all high quality and delicious. In shabu, unlike hotp pot, it's all about the Dip not the broth. We both got House Omakase ($45 per person). The Shrimp Grits Wonton and Truffle Cheese Hot Pocket was very unique. Beef and Pork thin and tender as what it should be. Very, very unfortunately though, the base and staple of hot pot - broth - is light. Now if you've had Chinese hot pot before, you'll know that as things cooks, the broth will become flavorful but two factors counter this to happen. (1) It's individual pots. With this, there's not enough time or collateral even if you throw everything in at once to bulk up the broth (2) Secondly, they come by and pour more dashi which kills the integrity of what you started with (which is again, light to begin with). Yes it's by Ramen Tatsuya but, importantly, one shouldn't come with expectation of tatsuya powerful ramen broth; one should come knowing a bit about shabu vs hot pot in fact.,Logistics: Now if you have hot pot /shabu before then by golly tell them and tell them firmly that you're good to go, just pick the food and decline the broth refills. If you're experienced, this will save you some time in explanations and the many interruptions you'll end up receiving. Definitely appreciate it, but it was hard to have conversations with my partner with so much interruptions.,If you're new, then maaaybe you'll value the lengthy explanations but it's overwhelming and difficult to retain with so much info. I ended up leveraging good ole experience in the end. ,Price: My bill was $110 (two drinks and two Omakases; no extras; figure doesn't include tip). The House Omakase is the least expensive combo but because menu is so complex and so much info is thrown at you, it would be countering all temptations of giving up and just ordering combo. They recommend three meats if you're doing a la carte ($7-12 each meats). With either approach you select, the waiters will come around midway with a huge display of ""special"" items both meats, vegetables, noodles and seafood that will definitely toss up your bill. It's visually appealing to see what you could have for an upcharge. The special items are difficult to gauge the worthiness, so it's essentially a gamble on just visual appeal. ,Misc. Make reservations. There's no standing room inside the restaurants and because there's so much going on in an experience, wait can be pretty long.,They ask for feedback at the end. I mentioned the broth. Their reply to the refills was this is the chefs intent to not have the broth thicken too much.

We had a reservation booked at 9pm but we still had to wait 20 minutes to get our table. I don't get the point of booking a table if you can't sit right away?! Eventually we got led in to the dining room and I had a great first impression.... our cocktails were delicious and the decor is really cool and clean. The concept of Shabu Shabu is awesome and not like anywhere we've been before in Austin. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive and the service overall was great. However, the food itself was a disappointment especially at such a high price point. The broth that comes with the Shabu Shabu was really bland and we left hungry after spending over $115 (we only bought two cocktails). We basically had a bland broth, a tiny bowl of rice, a few slices of meat, a tiny plate of veggies to share and a small dip. We also got one hot pocket and the blue crab gyozas to start and we were super disappointed. They both tasted soggy after we cooked them in our broth. The free watermelon granita for dessert was a nice touch though. ,All in all, the vibe, the decor, the service and the cocktails were fantastic. Unfortunately, although the food was of good quality and was fresh, there was barely any flavor and the portions were tiny.

If you're a foodie, you'll want to read this.⁠,DipDipDip is a Japanese-meets-Western shabu shabu restaurant, where you get your own pot of broth + numerous choices of meats, vegetables, and more to mix in, dip ... etc. It's fun, it's flexible, and best of all, it's f*cking delicious!⁠,I went with the konbu dashi broth + the ""omakase"" aka one of the chef's recommended combinations, which included the spectacular truffle sukiyaki, which was perfect with, well, EVERYTHING I dipped it in.⁠,To kick things up a notch, we got an order of Japanese Wagyu beef, which even came with certification straight from Japan (which you can keep).

I ordered the cheese dipping sauce, they accidentally gave it to the person next to me ( not a big deal) and put it in her pot.. 2 minutes later they realized it was the wrong table, they pulled it out of her hot pot and put it into mine!! She didn't touch it or anything but still..,This happened 2 other times as well with the À la cart items. Things were put on the table and then taken back.. again, not a big deal but when it's in my pot, it should stay.,Food was good but pretty  pricey.

Once again the folks behind Ramen Tatsuya have succeeded in bringing a little piece of Japan to Austin. From the beautiful decor (check out the bathrooms--almost feels like you are in someone's home) including the massive amount of table accoutrements to the simple but delicious food, everything is spot on.,We started with cocktails and the one with the blackberries is really good. But the perfect highball stood out for me. I'm not normally one to want any kind of water adulterating my whisky. But DipDipDip has a special Suntory Toki highball dispenser that they said is one of only 4 in the nation. It stores the whisky and the soda at super cold temperatures. I know it does more because the drink truly lived up to its name. It was such an easy drink, super bubbly and fresh. ,The food was everything I hoped for, especially the quality of the meat. One thing a friend advised and after eating here I can see their point: the expensive meat is almost a waste. Because you are cooking it in flavorful broth and then dipping it into very flavorful dips, you would lose out on what makes that wagyu so special. I advise sticking with the less expensive cuts as they are good enough.,I went with the tonyu nabe broth, which was very milky--I would recommend making it spicy as it needed something. My husband got the miso smokey and said it had a nice flavor. Definitely be aware that you will need to control the temperature of your broth. They set it at a certain temperature, but often I found I had to lower it to prevent it from boiling too hard. It was definitely something I had to keep an eye on throughout dinner, but I didn't really mind.,We ordered the raclette and mushroom pot pocket and later ordered another round because the cheese was just so melty good, especially inside a tofu skin flavored by the broth. The blue crab gyoza was flat out my favorite, though, with a lemony note that just made my mouth happy.,Of the dips we tried, the citrus ponzu that comes with the meal was my favorite. I also got the kagoshima, which was truly delicious and very brown buttery. My husband ordered the one with the 45 minute egg, which I thought was very good, if a bit thin. The sesame dip that also comes with the meal is super thick but very nutty and perfect with the pork.,After a while your server will wheel out this insane cart with food displayed on it. It was super kitschy and fun. I would warn you that if you really like noodles, hold off on your rice as they come out on the cart. My only complaint about the cart is that there was no printed menu nor a price list. I think it would be nice if they included a ""Cart Specials"" section to the menu so you could plan a bit what you might want to order. There was some amazing things on the cart as this is when the seafood came out and even a really beautiful box of mushrooms.,Once you hit your limit, they clear everything away and bring you this amazing-light dessert as a gift. Ours was watermelon shaved ice with tiny watermelon balls and this amazing yuzu creme fraiche. It was a perfect finish to such a gluttonous meal.,I have been waiting for this place to open for months and months and I could not be more happy about the experience we had last night.

The space is gorgeous, and the attention to detail, although at times a bit fussy, transforms you to another world. Service was top notch, even on the 2nd day of preview, and the 2 cocktails we had were fine and what you expect from a restaurant bar if you've dined at their other restaurants with bars.,Every diner is set up with a shabu ""kit"" of a personal nabe with choice of cooking broth, rice, and 2 traditional dipping sauces (a ponzu sauce and a sesame sauce). You can add extra flavorings and dipping sauces, and that is where the clever Texas twists start appearing (although we didn't opt for too many fusiony items). I got the Tonyu Nabe broth which has soy milk in it so as the night progresses you can pull off layers of curdled tofu skin from the surface of your cooking broth and eat! Having the controls for the heat next to you helped speed up this nabe-eating endeavor. You order meats and other items a la carte or choose from 3 omakase-style sets. We visited for the soft opening and were told a few high-end ingredients were missing from the omakase menus so we opted to a la carte which costs a lot more. Sliced beef and pork, shrimp meatballs, crab wontons, stuffed tofu pockets, fresh vegetables, and more all came out beautifully and thoughtfully and fresh.,Unlike Chinese style hotpot the broth here is merely a cooking liquid (at first) so some may be disappointed by the lack of salt if you skip the dip. Don't skip the dip! The main flavors and salt come from the dipping sauces. I enjoyed the ponzu citrus sauce the most but I'm more of a traditionalist. The additional kagoshima sauce (fish based) we ordered was also a favorite. The spicy funk (basically a kimchi ranch) was really good but is very rich and can be overpowering on boiled foods. I really liked it with the asparagus and wanted to dip some frites or tater tots in it though.,After you order and have eaten quite a bit, they push very pretty but (again) fussy carts around (like Emmer & Rye) with even more seafood, fresh tofu, and other specialty meats and wrapped items. TBH, I would've liked to pick from the cart earlier on. The noodles are also on this cart, and it actually makes sense to eat this later in the meal after the broth is flavored, but I would've liked to have started with some of the more delicate seafood and specialty items as by this time I was getting full. I opted for just one scallop (dipped in the ponzu) and it was the best item I had. The noodles were so fantastic and so QQ. Don't skip the noods! They said they make the noodles in house and we had the choice of flat ramen and udon. We got both and they did not disappoint. The fresh tofu was also great!,I was most looking forward to making the zosui, or rice porridge, at the end with my carefully saved rice and the now flavorful broth and perhaps a fresh egg if the kitchen would oblige. But we were so full I couldn't even think about another grain of rice after giving all of our extra meat slices to our neighbors. Make sure you save room (and your rice) to treat yourself at the end to table top porridge. I also found a pot of spicy chili crisp afterwards hidden on our table which made me sad I didn't get to utilize.,So here's the sad kicker. I'm completely disappointed that you have individual personal nabe pots instead of one large communal pot. There is something nostalgic and wonderful about sharing a large pot of the same flavors and treasure hunting together for that last mushroom at the bottom of the pot with your closest ones. And also making the communal porridge at the end! That convivial feeling is lost when you are steaming your face over your own personal pot that might have different ingredients than your dining partners. It is still a fun experience but you definitely feel disconnected from the rest of your table.

Except it's a 12 dollar warm water.,They sell alcoholish drink and charge 12 dollars, and it taste like , ice water. ,The meat is the only thing that's good about the resturant, except 3 meat slice cost 12 dollars, and it taste flavorless when you cook them with, warm water, of course.,It shouldn't be so complicated, it's so hard to fail to make a shabu because it's just so simple to make, this restaurant managed to achieve that, fail to make eatable shabu.,What you are paying for, is the ambient, the fancy chair, the well trained waitress that can explains the worlds most complicate, flavorless shabu. Well overpriced.,We end up spent 210 for 3 people, and we don't eat a lot, I think the place is ripping of people who never had experience with shabu, and done a bad job on the food.,I recommend the store to change name from dip dip dip to water water water, so at least I know what I am paying for.,Delicious! Steamy, so be ready- but the flavors are wonderful! ,They start you with your choice of broth, and a shareable box of veggies. I loved the red dipping sauce (fish sauce based), while my husband preferred the sesame based sauce... but both were fabulous. We literally drank the leftovers. ,For our meals, we didn't choose the chef choices, we went a la carte and couldn't be more happy, or full! ,Of course we got the Austin dip-and it was queso-licious! But let me be honest... it's queso, in shabu, that's boiling hot and steamy, with no utensils, and no way to get at the bottom of the container. Frankly, I'm a little sad at that. I'll let you make your own choices. ,They bring a specialty cart around at the end of your meal that has the chef choices and noodles to choose from. ,The seating is set up for 2tops, very few 4tops. Great atmosphere otherwise.,Delicious! Steamy, so be ready- but the flavors are wonderful! ,They start you with your choice of broth, and a shareable box of veggies.

The place is cute and very picture-worthy.,First qualm, you can't scoot your seat closer to the table. I understand why you can't scoot it back-they wheel around this large display of special food items between the tables, and don't want you to get in the way. ,That's not something you care about? Well, the broth is very bland. My table ordered one of each of the four broths, and the vegetable base was the best- which isn't saying much. They all tasted like water. I get that they want to emphasize the dipping sauces more, but then why charge $12 for a pot of hot water? I got myself the soy milk based broth, and regular milk has more flavor than it.,At first glance, the menu can be very daunting. You don't know where to start or what anything means. Just know that the meats are very good quality, everything else was weird. You choose your broth base, then you choose your meats/vegetables. They have preset omakase menus if you want everything. Not everyone at the table has to do the omakase together.,Then after you've ordered, they wheel through this cart with their seasonal items to get you to spend even more. They will bring out your items, and you cook them in front of you. ,In my party, we ordered the baller omakase and the tatsuya omakase, so we are not opposed to ordering high cost items, but at least taste good too.,TLDR: cool place. food sucks.,If you like being seen eating at a trendy place, then you'll love it here.

The service was quick and friendly. ,My eyes were instantly drawn to the mofongo, which I decided to order, but there were some very creative items on the menu. In particular the sandwich with plantains instead of bread is definitely on my mind for a return visit. ,As for the mofongo, I had the braised chicken with chalo sauce. The chicken was super juicy and was very well seasoned. The sauce blended together perfectly with the seasoning on the chicken. The mofongo itself was okay, a little too on the dry side for me, but it still tasted very good after getting it covered in the sauce. ,Overall I think it's worth giving a try if you're feeling Puerto Rican food and I would recommend giving some of their unusual menu items a try.,When I first passed by here I thought it looked kind of run down from the outside, but my friend and i decided to give it a try for dinner after seeing the positive reviews. ,There were no issues getting a table around 8 on a Wednesday evening.

Heaven that cheese flan like home or better.,We had the large appetizer sampler with meat and fried veggies. It only comes with two types of plantains and surullos. I wish there was more variety in this platter, as they had several other types of fried apps. It came with overcooked chicken and overcooked beef as well. The tostones and surullos were good.,I tried the pork mofongo one of my dining companions got, and found the mofongo to be very dry, to the point no amount of sauce could rescue it. The pork was just okay.,I had the Pechuga de Pollo. The chicken was dry, and certain parts of it had been on the grill so long they were burnt from one side to the other, not just due to a little grill mark here and there. The sauce on it was delicious. The cassava/yuca mofongo underneath it was basically one very breaded, very fried piece of yuca that was thinner than the breading wrapped around it. Then, there was an okay side salad with yummy dressing. Had my chicken not been so burnt, it would've been pretty good, but the serving size was underwhelming considering how small the yuca was. ,Service was decent, but the food was awful, especially for the price.,We had the large appetizer sampler with meat and fried veggies. It only comes with two types of plantains and surullos. I wish there was more variety in this platter, as they had several other types of fried apps. It came with overcooked chicken and overcooked beef as well. The tostones and surullos were good.,I tried the pork mofongo one of my dining companions got, and found the mofongo to be very dry, to the point no amount of sauce could rescue it. The pork was just okay.,I had the Pechuga de Pollo. The chicken was dry, and certain parts of it had been on the grill so long they were burnt from one side to the other, not just due to a little grill mark here and there.

Absolutely will come back again! The waiter Manny was super nice. We started off with some appetizers: Pastelillos which we got half ground beef and the other half pork & cheese. The dipping sauce paired with it was like a barbecue base and was fantastic. We also got the Bolitas de Yucca which was small fried round balls made do Yucca. ,For our entree, my daughter loves fried dish and had the chillo frito paired with rice. She ate everything to the bone! I had the Puerto Rican paella. It was very flavorful. The dressing that came with the salad was a vinaigrette base. Again, delicious! My significant other ordered the pulled pork with rice and salad. The pork was very moist and filling. ,We will come back again!,We were on a Latin kick this weekend and decided to try this little hole in the wall for dinner! Absolutely will come back again!

    ",Troy,"It was a busy day, it was staring to rain and we needed food. We looked for restaurants nearby and took a chance here. ,Turkey has one of the best cuisines I have tasted. Apart from Turkey's history and culture, the food is something alone you could travel there for. I never thought I would taste that again but here at this restaurant was authentic Turkish food in Austin!!!,I would definitely recommend coming here.,It was a busy day, it was staring to rain and we needed food.

Hard to find, but worth the find!,Appetizer: The hummus, saksuka (eggplant dip, not same as the Israeli shakshuka), and falafels all make delightful appetizers. I could have eaten just saksuka for my lunch- it was so well rounded in taste.,Mains: I've tried the falafel plate, lamb kavurma, and kofte kabab plates. Falafels are nice & crispy, six to a plate. The lamb kavurma is stewed lamb meat and wonderfully seasoned. The Kofte Kababs are mildly spicy (made infinitely better - imo - by their spicy sauce) and shaped like small beef patties. All plates come with salad and rice, with a few options for substitutions.,Dessert: The baklava is delicious and really well made. Two pieces to an order. Definitely get these.,Coffee: Finally, my favorite part, Turkish Coffee! If you haven't had Turkish coffee before, prepare for some bitterness, and plenty of grounds at the bottom. It feels like a coffee ceremony, served on traditional platters with Turkish delites and chilled water. (see pics!),In all, a delicious and reasonably priced lunch venue. Drink service can be slow if they only have one person on waitstaff, but is much better when there are two.,Troy is an authentic Turkish restaurant tucked away behind a gas station.

What have we been waiting for?? Trust me - put Troy at the top of your list of places to try. We were very pleased! ,We started with the Dolmades appetizer - The Best we have EVER eaten. Very tender, nicely seasoned.  My wife tried the Fasolia Plaki - A GF/ vegetarian dish that was just wonderful. She couldn't decide whether to clean the plate or take some home - she decided on the latter so we can enjoy it again. I ordered the Kofte Kebab which was also great. The menu says it is spicy and it does have a little heat, but that is just one element in the blend of seasoning. I would definitely order it again but am also looking forward to trying some other items. Finished with the Baklava - perfect crown on a delicious meal and great experience.

That may explain why the food did not taste super fresh. Turkish mezzes (small vegetarian appetizers) are the best part of a turkish meal. Unfortunately, the mezzes here, some of them tasted like they came out of the fridge, maybe made a day or 2 earlier. Not freshly prepared. Especially the baba-ganoush and the shakshouka did not have the freshly roasted eggplant flavor. They tasted soggy. With the appetizer sampler that we ordered, came only a few pieces of bread. The bread was not freshly baked. They tasted like pre-packaged pita bread that was warmed up on a grill. With good mezze you want bread fresh out of the oven, ballooned up and still steaming. That was not the case here. The main courses were good, but not 5-star good. We had the fasoli, gyro and the kefta kabab. They were decent. The gyro plate was greasy. Heated on the griddle. Not freshly sliced off the rotating spit. I guess we are spoiled by the delicious and always-fresh Turkish food at MezzeMe!

She loved it and so did we. ,I would highly recommend to anyone to give Troy a try. You won't be disappointed.,This was a great meal and an awesome experience. We love finding little family owned places like this. We were here on a Wednesday afternoon, about 4PM. The restaurant was fairly empty, so we got lots of one-on-one attention from the husband and wife team that run the place. We shared the Best of Meze sampler and the Iskender plate followed by Turkish coffee. The food was amazing! Thankfully we had read up a bit before coming and saw a comment about bringing our own wine. The owner graciously provided a wine opener and glasses. We will definitely be adding Troy to our regular rotation of dinner spots.,This was a great meal and an awesome experience. We love finding little family owned places like this.

I go to the Valero all the time and never knew it was there. I guess I wasn't paying enough attention!  I got the Kafte Kebab Plate. Very simple dish. I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender.

    ",Barley Swine,"Husband and I got a chance to try Barley Swine for dinner on Saturday night.  I made a reservation through RESY.  ,We tried their Chef's Tasting menu and wine pairing.  The Barely Swine team produces some of the most interesting entrees.  What a creative group!  We also ordered a few items from their A La Cart menu.,We had excellent service and enjoyed our dinner experience.,Including menus and pictures of our foods and wines/beers pairing.,Husband and I got a chance to try Barley Swine for dinner on Saturday night.  I made a reservation through RESY.  ,We tried their Chef's Tasting menu and wine pairing.  The Barely Swine team produces some of the most interesting entrees.  What a creative group!  We also ordered a few items from their A La Cart menu.,We had excellent service and enjoyed our dinner experience.,Including menus and pictures of our foods and wines/beers pairing.,Husband and I got a chance to try Barley Swine for dinner on Saturday night.  I made a reservation through RESY.  ,We tried their Chef's Tasting menu and wine pairing.  The Barely Swine team produces some of the most interesting entrees.  What a creative group!  We also ordered a few items from their A La Cart menu.,We had excellent service and enjoyed our dinner experience.,Including menus and pictures of our foods and wines/beers pairing.,We went during happy hour to avoid the crowds, there is not much parking in the front so go to the back and there will be a parking lot as well as street parking. Their happy hour is great as it is 50% off select items.,What we ordered:,Aged beef tartar with bone marrow and beef fat crackers - I loved this, the creamy bone marrow with the nice texture from the beef and crunch from the cracker was a symphony in my mouth. All the flavors and textures came together beautifully. My boyfriend on the other hand did not like this dish very much, as he put it ""I don't understand it"" 5/5 for me 2/5 for my boyfriend,Tostada with mushroom, chorizo, red potato, and goat feta - This was delicious, savory, spicy, with a nice hearty crunch. The dish had a comfort food feel to it. The mushrooms bring earthiness to the dish which gets a little lost in all the other ingredients but herb that they sprinkle over top - I believe its thyme- brings it all back. The goat feta added a nice creamy luxuriousness to the plate. Overall very good 4/5,Pig face parker house rolls with sweet chile mustard- The rolls were very rich and buttery, the meat on the inside was very tender and rich with a slight tang to it. Without the sauce the roll can be a little too rich, but with the sauce it is perfectly balanced. This was right up my boyfriends alley 5/5 for me it was good but not a must order item 3/5,Duck leg with Texas gold rice- This plate was absolutely killer. The duck is tender and delicious - although just a bit salty for my taste, perfect for my boyfriend though- the sauce is nice and buttery and the rice.... I don't know what or how they did it, but the rice was beyond amazing. I have never tasted anything like it before in my life. it was full of flavor beautifully fragrant and with the peach slices to lend tartness and sweetness and the green beans to add a nice crunch. As soon as you put it in your mouth it explodes with flavor. This dish was by far my favorite out of everything we ordered. 6/5,Overall I really enjoyed my experience, something that must be said is that the service here is phenomenal. From the hostess to the servers everyone was so kind and attentive. I have never been to a restaurant where everyone looks so happy to be working. I don't know what or how they are doing it but this restaurant has it figured out.

The course consists of roughly 9 bite-sized courses that lasts roughly 2.5 hours. The service here is great. The waiters are friendly and attentive. Additionally, they are knowledgeable about the wine menu, which is super important. My favorites out of the tasting menu are:,-wheat berries,-duck breast,-dry aged akaushi ribeye (so good but so small),-celery sorbet (great palate cleanser),-sweet potato mousse,My only qualm about Barley Swine is the price. The courses were a tad bit smaller than most tasting menus I've tried, making it feel like it should be worth around $80. Additionally, the wine pairing is around $55 which I find to be on the pricey side as well. Despite this, I still enjoyed the meal and would highly recommend Barley Swine!,I tried Barley Swine's tasting menu and really enjoyed it.

They cover a variety of meat selections with optional wine pairings. It's a wonderful experience if you're Down for this chef tasting. Definitely rsvp in advance because they are very busy . ,This tasting we had did take a very long time.

So plan accordingly! (Also, Google Maps took us to the parking lot in back and not the one in front. So weird.),Anyhoo, unbeknownst to us, they had happy hour. Yay! Our server very kindly informed us of this and 1/3 of the stuff we ordered ended up being half price or whatnot.,Food was pretty amazing overall. The only thing that didn't really work for us was the grilled octopus which came presented as a salad (covered in greens). The octopus was pretty strongly flavored (fishy).,Favorites: Shiitake dumplings (ordered as an afterthought), beef tartare, bavette, the rice in the quail dish,Presentation, ambiance and service were all on point. Definitely a great treat which made up for the long rainy drive to the restaurant. Might have to be a repeat if we're ever in town again, hopefully for the chef's menu.,One forgets that Austin is a full blown metropolitan city (the capital of Texas, no less) and that rush hour traffic is no joke, even if you're not in CA anymore.,Barley Swine was quite a trek for us from DTA...took about 40 minutes to make it JUST in time for our 6pm reservations.

The bone marrow and grilled octopus salad were excellent appetizers, particularly the marrow with the substituted lettuce. It was rich, decadent and perfectly portioned. The salad was crunchy, fresh and made us feel a little less guilty for ordering the sumptuous main courses of the grilled beef bavette and the pork shoulder. The beef was far superior to the pork, yet I doubt you would feel robbed if you ordered the pork. The beef was succulent and the accompaniments are perfectly balanced to the meat's umami. ,We skipped dessert, but overall an incredible experience, and one I can't wait to try again.,Visiting Austin on a staycation, we checked out Barley Swine since the reviews were so ecstatic. ,Instead of a full tasting menu, and being on keto, we were surprised that the servers were super understanding and willing to modify dishes...something we didn't ask for at all, but were incredibly grateful for.,I started with the texas tasting flight of whiskies, which were a delicious start to the meal.

Made a reservation for a group of 4 on a Friday night.,Our colleagues arrived before us, fortunately, they have valet parking so you don't have to search for parking. We stepped to the door and found our colleagues holding drinks while standing at the door. Why? There's no bar to have drinks. The bar is reserved seating. It was raining, so there was nowhere to stand while waiting and having a drink. huh. When I stepped inside, to tell them we were all there, it took them another 5 minutes before they could seat us.,The 4 of us all opted for the Chef's tasting with wine pairings. I am always up for an adventure when it comes to a chef's tasting and the chef utilizes ingredients from local farmers. Also, its very reasonable for $95 per person.,I found each item inventive and good. There were several selections that members of our group were not a fan. The service struggled a bit at times (sometimes they were spot on with telling us about a dish and at other times, a different person would come out later to tell us or pairings were brought a bit late or food was brought out at different times for our group of 4). There was not an empty chair, so it must have been a busy night.,A memorable dish was the wheat berries, kohirabi, smoke oyster w/ dill. Another was the crispy chicken skin with deviled egg topping. The dry aged akaushi ribeye, bonemarrow, tater tots was delicious.,Although service struggled slightly, the food was inventive and very good.,After Bourdain's praises on his show for Barley Swine, there was no way I was going to pass through town, without giving it a try.

Well, HH brought me in, ""Swine Time"", and even though I didn't stray too far from the Swine Time dishes, I was blown away by flavor and quality. So most people I go with, other than my husband, DO NOT want to split dishes, so restaurants should really stop trying to push it imo, but the food was great. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was rustic and lively.

The food was very good and several courses from tonight stole the show for me - sweet potato mousse, celery ice cream and the shrimp cocktail were great and not like anything I have had anywhere else. I was surprised that the duck course was VERY tough and the dry aged ribeye was not as great as I thought it was going to be. But the wine pairing were phenomenal for every course - extremely thoughtful and perfect sized pours.

From the start I want to say it was my best dinning experience in this city. I had the Chef's Tasting 10 course meal and what a wonderful mix of dishes and flavors.  I received a complimentary mackerel appetizer to wet the pallet and immediately knew this was going to be a special meal. As I bit into each plate I could taste the chef's balance of salt, fat and acidity perfectly.  As each course came afterwards they seemed to keep trumping the next, which was hard to believe.  Because of this fact it was hard to pick out my favorite dishes because each was truly was amazing. If had to pick I would say the ""Shishito Pepper Tómale"" and the ""Tomato, Blueberry, Grains, Green Chile Salad"" we're best of all. I will have to dine off the main menu the next time I am here, and there will most certainly be plans for a next time, as I am told it is equally appealing. Service was equally great as my water glass never ran dry, finished plates were quickly removed, and each of the variety of servers that attended my table greeted me with smiles and pleasant conversation throughout. To owner(s) and all workers of this fine establishment, thank you for the great meal and dinning experience.,I finally had the chance to visit the Barley Swine resturant for the first time since living in Austin.

    ",Uncle Nicky’s,"Ah! I absolutely love love this place! First of all, the location is right smack dab in the middle of Hyde Park and it's in a cluster of a lot of gems(Quacks, Julio's Cafe, Hyde Park Bar& Grill). There is a lot of parking out back so don't be alarmed when you see no available spots in the front. Walking into this place gave me that oldies/European coffee shop/diner feel if that makes sense. It's super clean with a lot of white accents and white walls and blue benches and blue accents. They have a happy hour from 2-5. The music playlist is beautifully selected, honestly, I think the music is part of the reason why I gave this place a 5 star rating. They were playing some good ol Marvin Gaye type of music and it was definitely setting the vibe,I happened to order the Dolce Vita. It basically is a milk shake with rum in it. I usually don't like liquor, in fact, I usually hate all things alcohol, but this was amazing and dangerous! It was dangerous because I couldn't taste the alcohol and I could've easily had 3 haha. (Not really because it's actually HUGE). It was so delicious and refreshing. I recommend it! I also had a chocolate chip cookie and it was super yummy, it had a crunch to it but yet was soft on the inside and had both milk and semi sweet chocolate chips in it.

It was the perfect size (I left full, but not bowled over from being so) and wasn't drenched in mayonnaise. The bun was pillowy and chewy - I overheard they get them shipped in from a bakery in NJ (I believe?). I love the addition of the banana peppers (or pepperoncinis?)...added a nice crunch as opposed to any heat. ,Enjoyed sitting at the counter and listening to a couple regulars shoot the shit with one of the staff. Good music, free wifi, and a few parking spots surround the place. I'd coin its vibe as upscale neighborhood diner that is also a bar vs anything else. ,I took two cookies to go. Usually I would have just gone with the chocolate chip one but something about that snickerdoodle disc of dough that had me say, what the heck, I'll do both! I'm so glad I did because the chocolate chip was fine, but the snickerdoodle was doodlerific! Good portion of sugar and cinnamon and the center broke easily in half, meaning it was cooked slightly less than done, and that's what really makes for a divine snickerdoodle experience.,Stopped by for lunch (went out of my way for, to be precise!) and the tuna sandwich was spot on.

I live really close by and haven't tried it yet after so long, I decided to. It was almost the end of the night, so the nice lady gave us pastries for free and they were really good. I went in with my fiancé and we just ordered the chilled shrimp plate because I couldn't find anything I was able to eat otherwise (most everything had some sort of meat or pork) & tbh wasn't in the mood for a salad. We just shared the plate. With that being said, it was no where near a portion I expected?? it consisted of a bed of pesto, 6 small shrimps, and some cilantro for about $9. It was good but needless 2 say I am still sad and hungry but that's not really their fault, no hard feelings. But overall if you're going to visit here, I'd say go for,pastries.,Since I was depressed and very hungry when I went in here, it may be swaying this review.

We stopped by here for an afternoon snack over the weekend on a Sunday. Were surprised to find that it resembles more of a modern coffee shop featuring a clean aesthetic and full bar vs. a mom-and-pop Italian restaurant. Lots of people typing away on laptops enjoying a glass of wine or gelato.,We sat at the bar and ordered a ton of goodies. The prosciutto toast was delicious with ricotta and a chili jam drizzle. The bread here is so fresh and crispy and chewy. We also shared the Caprese tomato mozzarella salad. The staff also convinced us to try the pork meatballs and they were divine. So mouthwatering cooked in marsala cream and pecorino - soft and decadent. Highly recommend.,Everything here is petite and share-able and so well-presented. The food is super fresh and the music was bangin and the staff are friendly. I adored my Garibaldi cocktail - a simple combo of Campari and fluffy orange juice. Sweet, subtle, citrus-y, and intoxicating. I could drink a carafe of this thing.,Delicious, quaint, charming, authentic, accessible, not expensive, and did I mention delicious?

I am so glad it's here and look forward to many more summer evenings spent on their patio, sipping a glass of vino and eating their delicious lil' toasts. ,The interior, design, and aesthetic, are great -- cool, hip, trendy, but not elitist or overplayed. The menu is simple, but from what we enjoyed, flavorful and satisfying. ,It's SUPER small, so it wouldn't be great for a huge crowd, but with a friend or two, this makes a great spot to enjoy a drink + share some plates, or grab a coffee and some gelato. I was pleasantly surprised that even their kale salad was a ""would order again,"" selection for me.,I LOVE this spot!

It works on the counter service model where you order your meal or drink and it will be brought out to you. While you were in line waiting for ordering, you can browse the gelato choices.,I ordered the tuna sandwich and it did not take long to arrive. It was a very sizable sandwich it was quite an Endeavour to take down. If you're not terribly hungry, it is likely enough for two people.,I also had the sardines. The presentation was very nice with Ritz crackers in the wrapper as well as sardines in the can. Very Tastefully done. Sardines hit the spot.,It was nice to go to sit outside and enjoy the day and have a nice lunch. Unfortunately, somebody photobombed my picture of the tuna, but I guess this will happen.  Great place to grab lunch.,This is a new establishment in Hyde Park.

We came on Sunday for their brunch, and everything was amazing. We had the Eggs Dominico, Truffled Eggs, and What's 'Nduja Tostato for food, and the Garibaldi and Breakfast Negroni for cocktails. The service was attentive and friendly, even for being pretty busy for Father's Day. I don't normally love mushrooms- truffles, but the Truffled Eggs were balanced and not too rich or funky. The Nduja Sausage with calabrian chilies were definitely spicy, but full of flavor with the Gorgonzola spread. The Eggs Dominico had prosciutto that was crispy and went perfect with the Hollandaise. Normally, most prosciutto dishes can be too thick, chewy, fatty, but since they crisped the delicate meat, it was on point. I can't wait to come back for dinner and try their salads and other tostato's!,This place met my expectations and exceeded them. We came on Sunday for their brunch, and everything was amazing.

I was curious about an italian place that didn't have pasta but they have many other options to scratch that carby itch.,Intimate, comfy hometown feel with 5 or 6 tables inside, covered outdoor seating and uncovered outdoor seating. Grab a menu and order at the register, open tab options. While in line to order, peruse the gelato and  pastry options.,Start light with an antipasti such as the elegannt carpaccio topped with arugula, a generous shavings of parmesan and olive oil.  Don't skip the meatballs, they are tender and covered in a mouth watering parmesan cream sauce. Both left me wanting to try more, such as the sardines, the cleverly named ham &eggs or maybe the mortadella stuffed peppers. Most are priced between $7-9 each.,The italian style toasts are done well, not overly toasted or too thick or chewy - just right. The classico was simple but satisfying with 3 slices of toast topped with ricotta, prosciutto and drizzled with chili honey. The prices make these toasts much more at appetizing at about $5-$6 each.,I found the kale salad to be a bit small and common for the price, the kale almost too big to take comfortable bites. Next time, i will try the impressive and large looking chopped salad. ,The pressed piadini sandwiches and cold sanwiches on focaccia look great and the prices are good - on my list to try next time. Not on the menu but up on the board, we tried the $4 taylor ham, egg and cheese sandwich which is exactly what you want it to be and more for that price tag.,Something for every mood with alcoholic beverages and classic espresso drinks. End (or start) your meal with a sweet! I sampled a birthday cake gelato, as well as the strawberry milk flavor - delish!,Dang, those $3-4 pastries, tho! That churro flavored krueller is just perfect - moist, eggy and slightly reminiscent of french caneles. The bombolini is so decadent and what every donut wants to grow up to be...they dont skimp on the filling, i tried the vanilla pastry cream vs the chocolate option and it was a pudding lovers dream. I also noticed some tasty looking cannolis, a jammy looking strawberry coffee cake and tempting fruit kolaches. ,Nice soundtrack playing in the background, free wifi, good service, open till midnight and excellent prices - sure to be everyone's favorite uncle!,A great addition to the atx fam!

I'd come here all the time if it were in my neighborhood. There isn't a ton of seating, so it definitely feels like a cozy neighborhood hangout. ,My friend and I got three toasts (pane tostato) to share - the Classico, ""What's N'duja?"", and the PB& J. We looved the PB&J (hard to go wrong with a classic flavor, but the ricotta definitely elevates it) the Classico was tasty (love the fresh basil) but we found the n'duja a mix of very strong flavors. I still liked it because I'm down for funky blue cheeses etc. but my friend wasn't a fan. With the nine slices of toast between the two of us, we weren't full, but satiated. ,I'll definitely be back for the breakfast sammies (the egg and cheese looked generous and satisfying), beautiful pastries, or a scoop of gelato.,This place is absolutely adorable!

It's a fast casual Italian-American snack bar, for a lack of a better description of it. You order at the bar and the food gets delivered. They have cocktails, strong Italian-style coffee, and snacking foods as well as sweets. ,They have panes tostadas (aka toasts) with many variety of toppings which makes me think that these are the Italian version of the Spanish montaditos (open faced sandwich bites, not so unlike bruschetta), except that these are a bit longer than the Spanish equivalent, and toasted. You can't go wrong with them - the four different kinds I tried were all good, with my favorite being the one with prosciutto. ,I also tried the piadina, the panini sandwiches but with flat bread instead of crusty or fluffy bread. The version here tasted fried and a bit overly greasy, which surprised me because I'm used to these being lightweight. I didn't particularly enjoy how this one was prepared here, and the filling of ham and cheese could be improved upon as well. ,The bomboloni, or Italian cream-filled sugar donuts is a rarity anywhere outside of Italy and South America - and it was a nice find here. They prepared it well but mine was a bit stale. These bombolonis don't hold long well, but I can tell they were well prepared. Perhaps I need to try it again earlier in the day instead of around 6:30 p.m.  ,I do like that they make pastries in house as well as their gelato. ,With minor improvements, or perhaps if I tried another dish that may be better, I'll probably bump this up easily to four stars. ,Atmosphere: walk-up counter, casual,Food: generally great with a few misses or tighter oversight needed,Service: behind the counter, minimal table service,Pricing: very reasonable, generally affordable with prices less than $10 but several plates would need to be ordered if hungry,I liked this place.

A very cool, authentic Italian spot. The playlist was bangin' everything from Biggie to the Beastie Boys. There's a good size patio on the side and the front of their space. They don't really have a sign, but their name is written on the front window. Look for the humongous Antonelli's sign. The weather was not cooperating for an outside hang, so it was tough to find a seat as it's pretty small inside. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We tried a handful of things and we were happy with them all. Espresso martini was delicious, and not too strong like martinis CAN be! The fluffy orange juice drink was my favorite, I think it's called Garibaldi. ,-Ham and Eggs were a perfect start to our brunch/lunch meal.

There's a slight kick of heat. This delicious sandwich is only $6! Can I say...new daily lunch spot?,Several of the antipasti dishes including the Carpaccio, Sardines, and Crudo are truly high-end restaurant dishes hiding in a humble little cafe.

The pecan gelato tastes like Lick's salted caramel flavor but with candied pecans sprinkled in. 100% yes to this.,Thanks, Uncle Nicky's, for coming to the neighborhood!,We came here for one thing so I can't attest to anything else, but the one thing we did have was so so so so so good! After seeing the crullers on insta I knew not having one was not an option so before dinner one night we picked one up. It was so airy and sweet! It's also pretty big so perfect for sharing, but I could have eaten the whole thing myself it was just that good!,We came here for one thing so I can't attest to anything else, but the one thing we did have was so so so so so good!

Mr. Smidgens loooooooves new places and  Italian specialties!!! ,Good thing Uncle Nicky's opened up in Hyde Park!!!,Everything on the menu looks delicious and they are open at 7am until 12am. Boom.,I started with the Garibaldi to wet my whistle. The cold Campari and the fluffy orange juice in a chilled glass are quite divine. ,For sustenance,  I ordered the salami & stracchino flat bread sandwich along with the chopped salad. ,The stracchino was so melty and creamy as it engulfed the salami between the perfectly toasted flat bread.  The chopped salad was everything you expect from an italian chopped salad.  Just like your Aunt would bring to the family gatherings! ,To wash it all down,  I ordered the Americano. Carpano Antica Formula, Campari, and seltzer with an orange peel. Quite refreshing!,Come out in the early morning for a tasty pastry and coffee or bring a friend for a delicious lunch or dinner with drinks. ,If you want some gelato they have that two.

I really appreciate that the new owners of this old Hyde Park location didnt break my heart, but have rather won it over. ,My only complaint: Please consider a more thoughtful music selection. You're going for the Italian corner cafe but your blasting tacky radio pop songs.

Nevertheless, Uncle Nickys will suffice as a replacement for my favorite hangout in Hyde Park (so long as the music taste can learn match the ambiance),Everyone I know was sad to see the old Dolce Vida go. For years it was the perfect utility player in the neighborhood: Laptop-friendly coffee house with light bites and gelato, and a full, casual bar with its own personality. You could come at any time of day and find it a great place to work or study, meet friends to hang out, or rendezvous for a date. I spent many days on the patio with my dog and laptop, working and sipping on coffee and tea until I convinced myself I'd been productive enough to earn a beer or cocktail. I'm not done mourning the loss of that neighborhood institution but I am encouraged to find the folks at Uncle Nicky's appear to have preserved much of what made the old place dear, and have added a clever menu of Italian specialties as a new facet to a familiar gem.,Here are some of the things they've kept: You can still grab a morning coffee and breakfast snack. You can still find a light snack for any time of day. You can still browse the gelato case at the front counter. You can still get a great cocktail. And you can still hang out with your human and canine friends on a nice, covered porch. ,What's new is a food menu that shines with sophisticated simplicity. What say ye to a selection of exotic Italian specialties with absolutely nothing over ten bucks? I say booyeah! To be sure, you won't mistake anything on offer for a plate from Juniper, a highbrow half-sister to this new venture, but you will likely find culinary ground you've yet to explore (note to self: try the Baccalá Mantecato next time).,The new interior is downright Spartan, but I like the idea that they're not trying for a splashy show to outshine the late Dolce Vida, but rather to start simply with a blank slate that might age and mature into its own organically evolved vibe. That's my wish, anyway. The fact that there's a signature cocktail named in honor of the old place gives me hope it might happen. I, for one, will raise a glass to honor the old and welcome the new.

    ",,"This place is an Austin college student staple. Iconic for their long lines back in their food truck days, their permanent location boasts the same delicious flavors with the added bonus of air conditioning and plentiful seating. ,The portion sizes are hefty and would fill up a very hungry person or create leftovers for a mildly hungry person. If you're looking to cut down on carbs like me when I was trying to go keto (but have since given up) you can replace the rice with cabbage (I actually prefer the crunchy cabbage even tho rice is life),My number one pick would the pork belly. ITS DA BOMB DOT COM. So fatty and juicy, melts in your mouth, warms your cold heart. Would definitely recommend. The classic katsu is also really good. Crunchy breading and flavorful.,The thing is wouldn't recommend is the arugula salad with tuna and roe. My friend had it (tryna be healthy I c u gurl). We all agreed that it was super salty, drenched in a mysterious salty concoction that left it frankly inedible.,Also the fries here are such bang for your buck. You get a huge portion!! Share it with friends or eat it yourself, I won't judge.,Lastly let me just commend the sauces here. They have unique sauces like the curry and wasabi sauce that pack such flavor to your meal. I would legit get some in the tiny containers to take home...,This place is an Austin college student staple.

Certified local eats, Dons is one for the ages my friends.,Location? Smack dab between what seemed like city streets and suburban neighborhoods, as well as the University of Austin all meaning plenty of hungry customers from various walks of life. If only politics were oriented around food, then maybe we could all agree on something, yeah? Because of the location facing the busy street side, I'd recommend parking in the nearby neighborhoods and walking just,around the corner to the restaurant. Everyone occasionally forgets that on Sundays and after 6pm weekdays parking is free so try to work those times to your advantage!,Atmosphere? Incredibly vibey if I do say so myself and poppin' with the crowds of people filling the tables; both sitting and standing options available. My opinion? If you're bringing friends and you want to sit, have one person go and try to scout out a bit while you guys order, otherwise stand awkwardly or venture elsewhere with your food while it cools (but that's never really cool, ya feel?) I do like to express my appreciation,of the simplistic art advantages that walls present, acting as both a divider and a convenient huge freakin' canvas... which is exactly what Dons does and does well at that! Perfect for snagging photos with friends and wallpapers, it's fun and free!,Food? Well here is the true bulk to behold. After sorting through their rather nice selection of dishes, we all decided on the Don w/chicken (because it's freakin named after the place, come on guys), Pork Belly, Kara-age as a side, & Don Style Fries (again, for obvious reasons). What we ended up receiving were essentially double what our imaginations originally concocted. Huge portion sizes between four smaller sized,people meant we could expect leftovers. The Don Style Fries were an easy favorite, first because they were waffle fries and waffle fries are just fun if I do say so myself and the added spicy mayo and teriyaki made them finger lickin' good. I'd say one is good between at least 2 people or even 3 or 4. Our side dish, the kara-age, well let's just say you couldn't really tell it was a side because it was the same size as our regular dishes, so unless it was a mistake, ima go ahead and count this one as a huge plus. Even if it was a mistake, then still a plus minus the huge part. Battered, sprinkled with seaweed flakes and drizzled with teriyaki sauce. Crunchy on the outside and hot and chewy on the inside, these were HUGE pieces of chicken that could easily be a couple of days,worth of food for the aspiring college student/meal prepper. Taking one look at each piece brought a funny feeling of regret as it was larger than my imagination. On top of the fact there were more dishes we ordered. The Don *cue the thematic music for Jaws*, is one big dish my friend. Breaded chicken, sprinkled with seaweed and drizzled over with special sauce and then laid on top of a bed of rice was a delicious meal to be,had, and to be had it was. The pork belly was so soft, tender that each piece essentially melted in your mouth, not to mention that it was another great massive dish. Each bite from these dishes were all full of flavor and massive in size that the only other thing that could make it better would be a cheap price... and ACTUALLY, it was pretty cheap! My wallet wasn't crying or tearing at all! :D The drink selection was pretty standard, although the water had a strange taste to it along with being warm, not exactly refreshing for the hot summers but not too much of a mention.,Overall Dons was a great place to eat and bring friends along. The people and area is friendly so you'll feel at home, probably due to the nearby campus vibe.

A high recommendation if you're in the Austin area and looking for a reliable place to a huge bite to eat.,Delicious, fast, and very filling bowl place!,What to get:,- Pork Belly $9.00 w/ Onsen Egg ($1) and veggies ($3).  Amazing and large enough for 2.  Comes with plenty of delicious pork belly and rice.  ,Tips:,- They pack the to-go containers with so much food that you can't really close it until you eat some of it,- It's not a sit-down style restaurant.  You order at the register then pick up your food when your number is called. ,- The line moves quickly ,- There is cafeteria style seating inside, but it also works as a great to-go place,Delicious, fast, and very filling bowl place!,What to get:,- Pork Belly $9.00 w/ Onsen Egg ($1) and veggies ($3).  Amazing and large enough for 2.  Comes with plenty of delicious pork belly and rice.  ,Tips:,- They pack the to-go containers with so much food that you can't really close it until you eat some of it,- It's not a sit-down style restaurant.  You order at the register then pick up your food when your number is called. ,- The line moves quickly ,- There is cafeteria style seating inside, but it also works as a great to-go place,Delicious, fast, and very filling bowl place!,What to get:,- Pork Belly $9.00 w/ Onsen Egg ($1) and veggies ($3).  Amazing and large enough for 2.  Comes with plenty of delicious pork belly and rice.  ,Tips:,- They pack the to-go containers with so much food that you can't really close it until you eat some of it,- It's not a sit-down style restaurant.  You order at the register then pick up your food when your number is called. ,- The line moves quickly ,- There is cafeteria style seating inside, but it also works as a great to-go place,I've tried this place when they still charged $6 for the original don... Now they charge $7 and even though they give you huge portions of the katsu/meats (more than before if I remember correctly), the food doesn't taste as good as it used to. The quality has gone downhill - and it's unfortunate!,On my most recent visit, I ordered the karaage don (fried chicken) and it was overly-sauced and really salty. Make sure you ask for light sauce on your don otherwise you will need to drown yourself with water after your meal! The rice to meats ratio is like 1:3. The taste of the meat itself was okay, but honestly I couldn't finish my don towards the end (and it's rare I don't finish my food!),I suggest you take out the food. Don't dine in, 'cause then you're trying to swat away flies with one hand while taking a bite of your food with the other. ,Granted, this place is the perfect grab 'n go. Food came out quick, and the service was friendly and courteous. Definitely don't deny yourself the pleasure if you're craving Don for some umami flavors, but I'd say walk around Austin and you may just find something better somewhere else.,I've tried this place when they still charged $6 for the original don...

It's only after eating Don that I'll start finding other things to do in town. If you live in Austin, count your blessings and go often (I'm living vicariously through you). If you're in town, make sure you stop by. ,Teriyaki chicken is my favorite; the chicken is super tender, and every time I have teriyaki chicken in other restaurants, I find myself disappointed. Also, the teriyaki sauce mixes well with the spicy mayo sauce. In fact, the combination is so good that they put it on their fries. And speaking of the spicy mayo, holy wow. It was so good that I took 5 condiment cups back to Houston and cooked with it! ,The only issue with Don is the nonexistent parking. My recommendation is to park in the residential street by the nearby Whataburger.,I live in Houston, and I literally drive to Austin for Don.

The setup inside was a bit different but still simple and efficient. I took my dad with me and we both got the Don with chicken.

From watching it grow from a food truck (where wait times were an 45 minutes long in the blistering Texas sun) into the brick and mortar today, I'm glad to say it has still remains an above average place to get food on the Drag. Although the price has increased steadily over the year, they still are meeting the quality they had a couple of years ago. Anyways, let's get on to the food (what we really care about):,You can't go wrong with the original pork don! Slather some spicy mayo on it and go to town. But if you're feeling a little fancy, try the karaage or nan-ban for some juicy fried chicken goodness . Their pork belly is so fatty and rich, you'll be in a food coma. I haven't really had their other dishes, but I'm sure they're just as good!,If you're ever with some friends, be sure to get the Don style fries. They give you a heaping pile of waffle fries drenched in spicy mayo and their teriyaki sauce. I find myself never finishing it alone, so why not share it with some friends :). ,Some drawbacks would be that the rice texture varies from time to time, being very gummy or just right to me. Also, some pieces are more batter than meat but the portion sizes definitely make up for it. ,Overall, Don has been a positive contributor to my college experience. I wouldn't imagine what I would do without it!,This place is something I have had a close relationship my time here as a UT student.

Don has been one of my all-time favorite restaurants for many years ever since it was a food truck. I can still remember the days when the Don food truck has more than twice the amount of people in line than all the other food trucks have added together because it gives you twice the amount food for half the price while being more delicious. Now at its permanent restaurant, everything is just as good. Not only is the food an absolute delight, the serving size weighs like a newborn baby, and workers are always super friendly. Yes, a lot of people complain that the food price has gone up, but it is still a such cheap meal, and I personally would not even be mad to pay twice the price for this food since each serving can really last me two meals comfortably. (Shh, no one tell the owners, so they don't increase the price). I always get the pork don, with fish katsu and egg, and everything just pairs so well together so well! And the sauce, oh my god the sauce. My girlfriend and I would bring more sauce home and add it to our own food to make our food taste amazing as well! Be warned though, the sauce is no joke with how spicy it was. There has been too many times where I got too excited and added too much sauce, only for my mouth (and later butt) to feel the wrath of the sauce. My only complaint with this place is the fries. They absolutely smothered the fries with the sauces, and it made the fries soggy and contain my whole week's worth of salt content.

She was nowhere to be found so I waited for a while before she came out and apologized for disappearing, coating my food with a sauce, and then giving me my meals.,I went to get some of the sauces and discovered they've gone down to just the spicy mayo. I asked her about the other two they used to have and she said they only had the spicy mayo. I got a side of that and went on my way.,When I finally got a chance to eat it, I realized she had entirely drenched the meal with a sweet sauce to the point where I couldn't even consume half of it. The chicken was dry and I noticed the amount of rice has gone down significantly since they opened.  I was okay with paying more than what I used to but rice is super cheap, I don't know why they couldn't have kept that part consistent.

You will get your money's worth!,I would highly recommend Don Japanese Kitchen! It's great!,tl;dr - JUST GREAT FOOD.,Service- 5/5. The guys, who sit in the front to take orders, are so sweet and friendly. Their bubbly personalities create a happy environment. It's always a great start to my dining experience with them. I love that they use a deck of cards as their numbering system. It's different. Lines are typical but worth the wait!,Food- 5/5. Don Fries and Don Chicken. This is the perfect combo!

You get sooo much food for under $10 - seriously it's like two meals that you can get with the amount of food they give you. I really recommend the blue ocean - it's like four crispy strips of ?shrimp? and has become my new favorite. Would recommend adding an onsen egg to everything you order! And definitely get the spicy sauce!! Another good menu item is the waffle fries! If you thought the entree portions were huge just wait till you see how many fries they give you- and they're all covered in the good spicy sauce lol. The fries spring rolls are good as well- so crispy!! I really miss the crispy pork belly option as an entree - that was some of the best food I've ever eaten.

The kara-age was definitely my favorite and was enough for me to get a couple meals out of it. It's basically Japanese fried chicken on rice with a bit of pickled ginger on the side. I also recommend the spicy mayo dipping sauce--it has just a teeny tiny kick to it. I also love the beautiful murals all over the walls.,There is basically no parking--only street parking.  So be prepared to walk.  It's close to the UT campus, so expect to deal with a bit of traffic at times.,Let's see...we tried the kara-age, katsu--both chicken and fish, pork belly...it was all pretty good and very nice portions for the price.

Pork belly is good too reminds me of my favorite Vietnamese dish growing up, Thit Kho.,The door opens exactly at 11:30 AM for lunch. The place is super cute. There are not enough seats for a large group to be there. The best time to go is right at 11:30 when it opens. The food gets out at a pretty fast descent time. At their busiest period, food takes about 5-10 min before they call your playing card pattern. ,I've had the Don Pork, Don Chicken, & Pork Belly. The Pork Belly is really juicy and the fat melts in your mouth. If you are feeling for a saucy kind of bento, the pork belly is the perfect option. For the Don pork katsu and Don Chicken Katsu, it's a must to order Onsen egg with it! Also, you should dip it with their house special spicy mayo! Everything is freshly made. They give you a super big portion. Especially their fries! If you're craving for fries, order the fries. The fries have a 3-4 people serving size. ,The location is far and there's NO PARKING.,For parking, you should park around the west campus area. It cost $1 per hour to park. But if you're a student, you should just scooter there are walk there to save money.,The door opens exactly at 11:30 AM for lunch. The place is super cute.

I'll definitely be back.,Craving home comfort food and being half Russian and half Polish, Brama was closest to home. Planned a few other places to visit since I don't frequent this area much. Hopped in the car for my day trip. ,It's located in a shopping plaza with stores that didn't have much foot traffic, parking was easy. Got there a little before 11AM so I waited in the car but I didn't need to as it had been open and serving a gentleman already.  The décor is definitely Eastern European. I was seated and delivered a menu and water. This is where I couldn't resist. So many options that I couldn't choose one. ,Ordered a cup of Borscht, potato cheese bacon pierogies, and Stuffed Cabbage, also some to go boxes because I knew I wouldn't finish it. The waiter, Matt, was knowledgeable and pleasant. It was about 5 minutes and my Borscht was brought to me. The portion was plentiful and it was served with sour cream and a slice of rye bread. It was the vegetarian selection and tasted good. Well, at first I thought it could use some seasoning but kept eating until the bowl was half empty and realized, okay it doesn't.,Next up were the pierogies, presented in a bowl with a side of sour cream. They were lightly toasted from the fry. I cut one into thirds and tasted. OMG, I was more than Home. These were so flavorful and delicious. The more I ate, the sadder I felt as these were better than my mother's. I think the bacon pushed it over the edge.  But that didn't stop me from eating half the bowl.,Finally the stuffed cabbage. These were not like home. They cut very easily and the filling tumbled out. It tasted good but more rice in the filling than I'm used to. The sauce was very mild as I am used to a robust tomato flavor.  ,There are plans I the near future to return for more pierogies.,Craving home comfort food and being half Russian and half Polish, Brama was closest to home.

Next time I will try other filling as everything was cooked well.  For entree we had veal tongue and Golubtsi (pork and rice wrapped in boiled cabbage).   It was very tasty and lite for such fare.,We had room for dessert and the crepe was cooked just perfect.  The crepe was in between a French crepe and pancake.

Know what I mean? Like missing out on the main event. Okay, these are the #firstworld demons that can haunt the proper Yelp experience.   ,But Brama itself is an unexpected delight, and while I'm still not completely sure how to tell Pierogi from Pelmini, I'd say order both and keep that horseradish coming. The Spatzle with bacon is superb, and the pumpkin soup truly is an homage to Gourd. Sour cream does go with everything here, especially the chocolate cake. I'm not kidding. ,The one thing that didn't thrill me was the cherry Pierogi for dessert, probably because I used to eat Comstock filling straight from the can. But that shouldn't be a trigger for you. Our server Matt was spot on, and if you happen to know an East Euro aficionado or tennis pro, bring them here - I'll bet the kitchen staff can do remarkable off-menu items, if you know what to ask for.

Add on some quality Eastern European hospitality, I'm hooked.,The eggplant with walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds is a great starter, you won't be disappointed. Progress on to one of their hearty soups then maybe try something that's on special. The star of the show will be the pelmini and you should aim for variety: meat and veggie, boiled and fried. Definitely splurge on some beet horseradish, it's pretty mild and pro move is to mix it with the sour cream. ,The sour cream cake for dessert will knock your socks off.,Brama is a hot and new restaurant in Austin that is also highly underrated. Fun fact, they're the only pierogi place in town because austin pierogie closed. I walked in on a Friday night and there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant at prime dinner time. We need to give them some more love! I ordered the cabbage rolls, spelled galumpkis, fried pierogies, steamed pelminis (meat filled dumplings) and their herring potato. ,Tips: you need to add beets to the pelmini, it adds so much sweetness and contrast to the dish. Bacon to the pierogies is a must too. Herring potato is kind of out there and it's icy cold, so don't expect like roasted fish! The cabbage rolls are a must!,Overall: pricing is appropriate for the atmosphere and taste is there.

The inside decor is rustic, cozy, and slightly upscale because of the chandeliers and dark wood. ,There's a small bar area where we sat since all the tables were taken. We started with eggplant rolls and fried pierogies with feta, potato, and spinach. The eggplant rolls were pretty with pomegranate seeds and chopped parsley. I just wish there were more than three rolls. The red beets that go with the pierogies have  horseradish in them so be careful not to get too much! I made that mistake and cleared out my sinuses a few times. But both were so yummy. ,My husband ordered the golubtsi and I ordered the pork schnitzel with spaetzle. Golubtsi was really good and the pork schnitzel was also perfectly thin and crisp. Spaetzle was meh, it was a bit dry and cold, should have gone with the mashed potatoes instead. Overall, it was a great experience and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.,I've been looking at this restaurant for a while and we were finally able to try it out on a Saturday night.

I often crave the German/ Polish dishes I grew up eating, and wondered why there was such a lack of Eastern European options in Austin's food scene. This place has awesome borscht (beet soup with potatoes and other veggies, plus beef if you don't wasn't the vegetarian option), really lovely pierogies (aka Polish dumplings, often filled with things like potato and cheese or mushroom. Make sure you get it with the beet horseradish sauce!), and golubstsi (cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and rice in a tomato sauce. It's better than it sounds, I promise. Also, where my family is from, it's pronounced hall-oop-chi, but feel free to just point at the menu.) One note: skip the kielbasa. You get about 1/4 link in small slices, buried under very bland sauerkraut, so don't bother. Everything else at the table was raved about. ,We also tried the Russian ice cream with cherry and black currant preserves, which was a really lovely surprise. Quite a different taste than American ice cream. We'll definitely be back to try the dessert pierogies--they're filled with tart cherries, and served with sour cream and a sprinkling of sugar, just like my great-grandma used to make :) Even if you didn't grow up with this food, it's absolutely worth a try.

I tried the golubtsi and they were pretty good. Not mind blowing however. I also tried the vegetarian borsch and it didn't taste quite right, and I only got one tiny piece of toast (the butt of the bread). It's pretty expensive for small portions.

number of Central European dishes throughout the region, the European influence dissipates as we move further to the East.  As a result, there are just a few restaurants in Austin and San Antonio where Russian or Slavic dishes are covered.  Thankfully, Brama Restaurant has found its way to North Austin, and it delivers in spades.   ,We started with some Russian dumplings.  These tiny morsels were filled with a pork and beef mixture and then pan fried.  We ordered ours topped with bacon and sour cream on the side.  Years ago, I had a similar dish at a Ukrainian restaurant in Spokane, WA.  I'm happy to report I no longer have to pine for a dish across the country.  The pelmeni is legit.  ,Of the three entrees we ordered, my schnitzel was probably the most appropriate for a less adventurous palate.  Still, the chicken had been pounded very thin and perfectly fried.  A charred lemon was served on the side for extra flavor.  The mashed potatoes weren't very noteworthy, but the beets were a fantastic accompanying side.  ,If you order the kielbasa, you will love the meat and be pleasantly surprised at the amazing accompanying kraut.  I was prepared for that dish to be our favorite until I tried the beef stroganoff over homemade spaetzle.   Frankly, this was the best preparation of the dish I have had in my entire life.  The cream based sauce had an elegant sweet taste to it that perfectly accented the noodles.  The beef added another layer of flavor, but I didn't really detect any mushroom flavor in this preparation.  It didn't matter.  I could eat that for the rest of my life.  It was absolutely spectacular.  ,The menu isn't large, but there are quite a few entrees I'd like to try on subsequent visits.  If you live in North Austin, you should go here.  If

I loved it. ,The beet and goat cheese salad was simple but very well balanced: the slightly candied nuts rounded out the creaminess and earthiness of the plate. My husband and I shared an entree of the beef stroganoff with spätzle, which was very satisfying. This meant we still had an appetite for dessert, which was surprisingly delicious! Brama offers several appealing cakes; we went for the Neapolitan (or was it Napoleon?)--a baklva-like custard cake--and were very pleased. ,The service was warm and friendly without being overbearing, and our sever was genuinely enthusiastic about the food, which I always appreciate. The only part of my experience at Brama that was lacking was the ambiance and decor: despite the low lighting, which gave it a cozy feel, the decor was sparse, the utensils came wrapped in paper napkins, and the cups were plastic. These details don't really detract from the meal, but if they were upgraded just a bit it would give the Brama as especially homey, cozy feel.

Either way, it's definitely worth a visit!,[5 stars for the food and service, and 3 stars for the ambiance.] The food at Brama is hearty, homey and satisfying--I was most looking forward to the pierogis, and they exceeded my expectations! (I'd recommend adding the caramelized onions to your pierogi order, too.) The kvass, a non-alcoholic fermented drink made from rye bread, was the surprise hit. I loved it. ,The beet and goat cheese salad was simple but very well balanced: the slightly candied nuts rounded out the creaminess and earthiness of the plate. My husband and I shared an entree of the beef stroganoff with spätzle, which was very satisfying. This meant we still had an appetite for dessert, which was surprisingly delicious! Brama offers several appealing cakes; we went for the Neapolitan (or was it Napoleon?)--a baklva-like custard cake--and were very pleased. ,The service was warm and friendly without being overbearing, and our sever was genuinely enthusiastic about the food, which I always appreciate.

Either way, it's definitely worth a visit!,Loved this place! Had a huge lunch today with my girlfriend and tried lots of things. The standouts were the beet and goat cheese salad, the pierogies (we had the potato bacon cheese ones), the sausage and kraut with spaetzle, and the ice cream with black currant preserves. ,The beet goat cheese salad is really beautiful and has great complimentary flavors from the arugula, nuts, and fruit that comes with it. I will get this every time I go. We also started with the meat borscht. It was hot and delicious and came with a little sour cream on the side as well as dark bread with beef fat on it. I like sour cream in my borscht and eventually added it, but it certainly didn't need it. ,Next we had pierogies. We loved the pierogies! We went with the ones recommended by our server Tatiana, the potato bacon cheese. Really freaking good!! The beet horseradish and sour cream on the side are the perfect extras too. Can't wait to try all the different flavors!,For mains we had pork schnitzel with spaetzle and red cabbage (big portion for any of yall with a big appetite), and sausage and kraut with spaetzle. Both were tasty but we both liked the kraut better. It reminded me of the version my grandmother made. ,For dessert we had the ice cream with black currant preserves and it was really great! Get this! Soooooo good. ,We also both really liked our juices we ordered. They have a few flavors to choose and they come nice and cold in a full pint glass. Her's was peach, unfiltered and not too sweet. Mine was black currant and I had to try hard to not just drink it all right away. ,Tatiana had great recommendations and was very knowledgeable too.

It was a really great experience and I will be back soon!,We're both descendants of Polish and Russian grandparents, so needless to say, we were pretty excited to hear about Brama opening. We went on Friday night, right when they opened at 5:00, and were the only ones there except for an older gentleman who seemed to be a regular.,We started with mushroom and potato pierogis and Siberian pelmenis. Both dishes took a really, really, reeeealllllllly long time to come out...and sadly both were disappointing. The pelminis themselves tasted fine, but there was seriously half a bowl's worth of melted butter in which they were drowning. The pierogis were crisp, but the filling was lackluster. What is amazing, however, is the beet-horseradish dip that we ordered with it. That'll clear your sinuses up real fast. For dinner, we shared the kielbasa plate and the beef stroganoff. Each dish was average but the meat in the latter was way too tough.,We loved that our server was ""authentic"" and are happy that this place even exists in Austin. Would we go back again? No--but that's because we grew up with this food and know the difference between good and not-so-good. Do we think that other folks should go and try it? For sure.,We're both descendants of Polish and Russian grandparents, so needless to say, we were pretty excited to hear about Brama opening.

The green curry was slightly sweet with a nice kick of spice, although I do wish they would give us more rice for the amount of curry.

That being said, do be aware that their noodle dishes are just eh, but everything else is great.,The red curry is my personal favorite. The soups are really full-bodied and taste great too. While a bunch of Thai places taste like they just use water to make the soup, Titaya's actually tastes like a broth base. I think that flavor comparison in general shows how I feel about Titaya's as compared to many other places.,The noodle dishes are not very special to me, because I think that a lot of places are able to make the noodle dishes well. But the curry here is so good. It's on the sweeter side, so beware of that, but the portion sizes are really fair, and the price is decent for such good food. Seriously, I can't stress enough how amazing the curry is!,My only advice is to ask for extra spiciness when ordering if you love heat. I find that 1-2 spiciness is not enough, and 3 is when it starts to get decent. 4 is probably around Thai spicy, so I would only get that if feeling brave. For example, with the red curry (2 spicy default), I always ask to up it to 3 for a decent kick!,I think Titaya's is the best place for Thai curry that I've found so far in Austin.

Good stuff.,They say do what you love and you'll never work a day. Well I love to eat Thai food and Yelp gives me an outlet to speak about my passions. My love affair with Titaya's began in 2014. Titaya's had been closed for some renovations and I had yet to try it. When it finally reopened, I fell in love. ,I have since moved to another city (with good Thai food, don't worry), but I still dream of this place. ,I personally recommend going for lunch. Order the lunch special Pad See Ew with soup, Tom Yum soup to be specific. It's a party mentally, physically and spiritually.,They say do what you love and you'll never work a day.

Will definitely return to try a curry dish.,Six of us had dinner here on a Friday night at 5:30pm and the place was almost empty.  However by the time we left it was packed, with most every table taken.  The food was delicious.  I loved my Pad Thai made with some extra spice!  Others in our party had fried rice dishes, a curry dish and a house classic dish.  If you ask for spicy be prepared as a couple of dishes were a little too spicy for some of my friends.

Ordered the Pad See Eiw with fried tofu, and it was so tasty! Broccoli had a nice bite to it, and fried tofu didn't become soggy at all.,My friend was eating Thai food for the first time, and the waitress mentioned how their fresh, hand-cut noodles make a difference. Boy, was she right. Light and chewy, these noodles have a more delicate texture compared to other places I've tried in Austin. If this dedicated paragraph doesn't convey my love for them enough, then I must be doing something wrong.,For the price, the portion was well-sized and filling. Enough for a small bit of leftovers, which held up the next day. Parking is fairly easy since there's a parking lot. Service was friendly and our food didn't take too long to arrive.,One downside is that Titaya's doesn't split checks, but you can work around that by telling your server to charge a specific amount for whichever card. ,If you've made it to the end of this review, go reward yourself with some Titaya's!,The noodles at Titaya's are what dreams are made of, and the reason I edged this review from a 4 to a 5. ,Came here Saturday for dinner.

Pad se ew is kinda bland. They don't do chili oil, which I think is strange. Just sriracha. Brisket fettuccine is really good. Corn taro fritters are really good. And the chicken wings have a nice flavor. The Thom kha soup is really tasty, nice kick to it. I got it with shrimp, they were a bit overlooked and they keep the tails on. Sticky rice was yummy.

It seemed a little unclear which are the mezze (two are included with your bowl; one in the pita; additional mezze are $2 each) and which are the toppings (gratis) once you step away from the menu on the wall and move down the line - could result in inadvertently ordering a dish with a number of up-charges. Watermelon juice was delicious! ,The new ordering system didn't work well for us last night. We were behind a group who was unfamiliar with Turkish food, and now that the selections aren't visible to the customers or described on the menu, the ordering process took much longer than usual. When we received our food, mine was not correct (which never happened before when we were able to see the bowl being made). Disappointing.,I love Mediterranean Food. A lot. I love the tangy flavor and smooth texture of tzatziki sauce that pairs so perfectly with a gyro and pita bread. I love dolmas paired with a citrus spritz of lemon. And I love anything generally spicy and pickled. ,My husband does not like Mediterranean food, so it proves difficult for me time and time again to enjoy some fresh falafel fare. ,My kid, though he inherited everything from his father in the looks department, he shares my love for hummus and pita. With my tiny companion in tow, I finally decided to try this place in the Triangle that had been taunting me everything I leave CorePower Yoga ravenous for a substantive meal. ,Pleasantly surprised to discover it was a fast-casual set-up, Gus and I strolled up the counter and started building our meals. First, you pick a base (crazy grain, pita, spring mix, or long rice grain) then load it up with all the goodies and various proteins available. The food was fresh and they didn't skimp on the where it really matters - the toppings. All the dolmas, hummus, tzatziki, red cabbage, pepperoncini and feta cheese a Greek-food-loving girl could ask for. Gus devoured his hummus like a champ, too! ,The space is clean and offers a lot of seating, and the service was just fine.

I also love how you can customize your orders, so I do things like getting half crazy grains and half salads. Meatballs are great. Get their eggplant side dishes! Highly recommend the shakshuka, if you don't mind a strong garlic taste.,Service has been quick and great whenever I've been there, and sometimes they'll even give you Turkish coffee on the house or help take away your dishes afterwards.,Love this place, what a great hidden gem in the Triangle!,Portions are great for the price, and the food is wonderful.

Always so fresh, not greasy, perfectly crisp on the outside but flavorful and moist inside. It doesn't get any better than that. I'm blown away by each sip of lentil soup that I take - how can that much delicious flavor be in every bite? And the bowls are spectacular. So much flavor, everything perfectly cooked and fresh. Such a wonderful variety of veggies - and that broccoli   Can't tell you how excited we were to find a place that serves wheat free and vegetarian dishes in Austin! Bonus points to the ambience of the space itself, the incredibly friendly staff, and the speed with which they prepare the food! We just moved to Austin and this is already a new local favorite.

    ",Patrizi’s,"I had been pretty excited to try Patrizi's after my first glowing recommendation. My roomate and I tried to go a few weekends ago, but stupidly we went on a Saturday night and the line was just too long for us to bare. When we found ourselves hungry late on a Sunday night, we decided it was time to try.,While we didn't have to deal with a line, they were sold out of a few food items. Sadly, they didn't have the Carbonara Alexandra. BUT the girl working outside the truck recommended we get the Cacio E Pepe and add egg and bacon. We did, and the guys working were friendly enough to not even charge us for the extras. I decided to order the roasted beets with the extra money.,The roasted beets were OK. Good healthy-ish snack while waiting for the pasta. But the pasta blew us away. So good. So fresh. I am not even qualified to talk about the flavors I encountered, but needless to say, I'll be back again to try more.

This place is bomb.,There's a lot to like here, though the charm here is wearing a bit thin for me these days. Located in an excellent courtyard shared with Vortex Theatre and Butterfly Bar, the vibe is about as good as a food truck can offer. The food is always honest and the thin, flat handmade pasta is qualitatively different from most. Prices are reasonable for what you get. ,That said, you may want to sit down or stop reading now while I go off on a bit of a rant: It's a frickin' pain in the ass to eat here. You stand in a line to order. You won't get a good look at the menu posted next to the window until you're next up to order. They'll ask you where you're sitting but unless you've left some valuables parked at a table you won't have one claimed. If you want anything to drink other than water from an igloo cooler you'll have to then stand in line at the Butterfly bar next door. You'll be halfway through that beer/wine before you get your food and you're not getting a second glass because flies will cover your plate the second you get up to go back to the bar. Your food is served on a paper plate with a plastic fork, but don't ask for a f**king paper copy of your credit card receipt because they're, ahem, ""zero waste."" When you're done you'll feel like a bit of a tool if you don't bus your table and sort your waste between landfill, recycling, and composting. You'll have to decide up front how much of a tip this level of service does or does not warrant... pick a number between ""tool"" and ""sucker"" or split the difference and feel a bit of both.,The food, as I mentioned previously, is always honest. And while it presents with a hipster foodie kinda of authenticity, I'm less certain of its *Italian* authenticity and you can't help but notice the limitations of running a restaurant out of a small trailer: There's one variety of pasta. You pick a sauce and a protein as a side order. Then maybe they tell you they're out of chicken after you've ordered and would you mind having a meatball and tomato sauce with your arugula pesto because those go together about as elegantly as...,Ahem.,So, why am I writing a pissy rant and still giving four stars? Because it's good food with a good vibe in a cool space even if my familiarity with it has bred contempt. Make what you will of that.

The portion size were good for 4 people and very decently priced. ,The ambiance of the place is great too- very well lit garden seating and the bar next door(butterfly bar) offers some great cocktails and wines  ;) ,Heads up - the food usually takes 20-25mins to come out, this is a bit of a known fact so don't be surprised !,Best Italian(/Pasta) I have ever had in Austin Tx and it's not from a restaurant but a food truck!, ,We ordered the great Leopold and karah's Diavolo pastas - they were Delicious.,My favorite was definitely the Diavolo - the lemon olive oil and garlic blend was amazing. ,For starters we got the assortment bruschetta and marfa tomatoes - both lovely again.

Best Italian food that I've had in Austin. All from a little food truck. Be ready to stand in line, but there is an outdoor bar you can get drinks at while you wait. And sangria was $4 during HH, so pretty much the best situation. Once you order your food, it doesn't take that long to come out. I added chicken and honey to the Cacio e Pepe and it was incredible. The bruschetta had a unique approach with three different toppings. The seating is all outdoor, so dress appropriately in the summertime! Will definitely be back!,Wow.

Patrizis is a food truck that sells pasta outside of a truck but it's also a restaurant in where you sit down, can enjoy drinks from a bar, and have food served to you. You pay all the fees upfront before you receive the service.,I came here with my USIT organization with 10 people without a reservation. Despite us not making a reservation, they still greeted us kindly and let us know to do so in the future with such a big party. ,The line was very long and took about 30minutes to get through. However, while waiting in line, servers would come talk to us to let us know more about their food and what choices were available.,I'd say my favorite thing about this place would be the atmosphere: all the servers are super nice and service is good, there are lights everywhere and bustling business, and it's just a fun environment.,However, most people would acknowledge this place is a bit pricey for just pasta noodles. Their menu are noodles with different sauces/toppings/meats but amount to about $11-15 with an added side dish for an additional $4-8.,While a bit expensive for pasta, I got the Great Leopold which is a pesto pasta with sunflower seeds and no meat. I enjoyed my pasta and it filled me up. I payed around $15 for the pasta itself and tip. So a bit pricey but pasta was good, not anything exemplary but good enough.,First of all, this place is SUPER Austin-y.

The egg in the middle really pulled everything together. Would definitely recommend!,Also got: bruschetta ,Some of these flavors were a bit unexpected but still delicious nonetheless.

I could tell this place was popular because the line was SO long. ,Patrizi's offered a ""Dinner for Two"" option, which was a pretty solid deal...I had the chance to try the Carbonara Alexandra (feat. runny egg yolk sitting in the middle of a bed of *amazing* homemade pasta), a [massive] meatball, Patrizi's salad, garlic bread (super buttery and delicious), the Great Leopold (which was amazing), and a fantastic dessert with cookies and a rich creme that I couldn't get enough of.,I really hope to return someday!,Carbloading in a garden never felt so good.

Pasta was chewy (in a good way) and not dry, and the simple flavoring cheese, pepper, and olive oil really let the pasta shine. The carrots and creamy sauce on top were also good, and a nice balance to the pasta. The garlic bread is still holds the title for my favorite thing from Patrizi's though - if you love bread and garlic, it's seriously heaven in your mouth! ,Came on a weekend evening and there was an event going on at The Vortex, so the place was popping. The line was long, but was moving decently fast and someone brought out a sample while we waited. There's a good-sized parking lot, but it can be tricky finding a spot when it's busy. ,I enjoy the more simple, fresher taste of Patrizi's, so I would come back again.,I tried Patrizi's a second time and really enjoyed it this time around! ,Ordered the the half portion of Cacio e Pepe and side of local vegetables, which ended up being carrots.

They make everything from the freshest ingredients, and it definitely shows in the final products. On this visit I got to try the Patrizi's red sauce with a meatball, the Carbonara Alexandra, and the Garlic Bread. All three dishes were great portion sizes and even better in flavor. The fresh pasta provided great texture to both dishes. The red sauce had a deep and rich flavor, and the carbonara provided a nice smoky flavor from the house cured bacon. The garlic bread is made from toasted ciabatta bread and loaded with whole roasted garlic gloves. Not only is the food top notch, the commitment to service is evident across the board as well. Patrizi's is a great representation of the uniqueness and high quality of Austin's food scene!,Patrizi's is a food truck stationed in an eclectic backyard/patio area behind the Vortex.

I went on a Tuesday night and there was absolutely no line no wait. The location is so quaint quirky and adorable I loved it. It's a cute food truck like stand with outdoor seating. Lots of seating with picnic style tables and spacious eating area. I love the decor and lights, at night it has a really great vibe especially with the vortex bar next door it feels really lively and quintessentially austin.,Now for the pasta, I got the regular red sauce and the carbonara with added honey. You seat yourself and they bring it to you. The wait was kinda long ish but I could imagine it be very long on a busier day so expect a wait time. I'd say we waited 15 mins.,The pasta itself was great. Normally I'm used to a softer noodle but this one was a bit chewier with some resistance to it. Wasn't hard or tough though. Just has a bite to it which at first I wasn't used to but then I grew fond of it. My friend wasn't a fan however as he likes his noodles softer.,The flavor of the red sauce was much on point. Strong tomato flavor with a good amount of cheese and seasonings. Unfortunately they ran out of meatballs by 9:00 so the pasta did feel like it was missing something.. needed some protein. ,The carbonara was a refreshingly different from the red sauce especially with that honey. The honey gives an awesome sweet and savory taste, would recommend, really brings out a meaty rich flavor. I think there was meat in this but it was sparse but I did enjoy having something meaty to chew on between bites of pasta.,I liked both these dishes equally and I'd say this is pretty good pasta. Me and my friend both agree it is somewhat overhyped and weren't totally blown away (maybe our expectations were already too high) but hey it was still a really good satisfying meal. I ate the whole plate and felt very good, at first the portion size seemed small but it turned out to be the correct size for one meal, no leftovers. All pastas under $12 as well.,This place was really hyped up so I knew I had to try it. I went on a Tuesday night and there was absolutely no line no wait.

They have folks greet you in line and walk you through the menu if you're a first-timer.,Despite the overall loveliness of the place, the food was unfortunately the only blemish on an otherwise home-run. The pasta is very Al-dente, which is not in and of itself an issue, but it seemed inconsistent across the different bowls we ordered (some folks more than others). The food overall was OK, but certainly not the high point of the evening.,Patrizi's is an amazing space that perfectly captures the East Austin subculture.,The venue is primarily a beautiful outdoor patio space and ""attached"" to Vortex, a quirky, delightful theatre that adds music and color to the overall area.,Lines are usually aggressively long on nice evenings so plan to wait at least 15 - 45 minutes before ordering, and another 15 for the food to come out.

Everything from the food and service to the ambiance of the location is sheer perfection.,While you wait in line for what (surprisingly) appears to be a food truck, restaurant staff greet you and walk you through all the menu options. You can't go wrong with anything, but pay especially close attention to the daily special because those have never failed to blow me away. After ordering, you're welcome to sit anywhere in their large patio area, which is host to different events every night ranging from trivia nights to an adult comedy troupe. The water is self-serve, so drink to your hearts content, and there's often a bar right across from Patrizi's truck. ,Expect your food to cost $15-20 per person, which is a tad more than I'd generally like to pay for a meal, but it's well worth the money. Also, be aware that going in the evenings nearly any day of the week will have you waiting at least 15 minutes, while Thursdays thru Saturdays will have a line our the door taking far longer. However, if you show up right when Patrizi's opens at 5, ordering should be a relative breeze. ,As a ""every once in a while"" treat, Patrizi's is among the best restaurants in Austin.,Patrizi's is said by many to be the best Italian restaurant in Austin, and I'm inclined to agree.

We got there a little before they opened - there's not much around to do, so I'd try to get there as close as possible to open. It's a little hard to find, it's behind the laundromat and uses the parking lot with the sno cone truck, and is behind the Vortex building. The people who work there are really nice, they came out a little before open and let us know what they did and didn't have, and were kind enough to throw in a free garlic bread - unsure if it was a waiting long time, first customer, or just cuz - but really appreciated it!! The food was very good. The garlic bread was fantastic, as was the carbonara. We also got the red sauce pasta and a side of meatballs with farm cheese (very similar to ricotta). The meatballs were probably a little too over seasoned, but still very edible just not same caliber as the rest. The pasta was clearly made that day - a really fresh, egg, never dried taste. The seating area is also very cute, very restaurant not picnic table vibe. Will definitely be back next time we're in town!,Really great pasta!

This restaurant is a food truck that's nestled in the yard of a theatre and bar with lots of open seating. ,I came with my SO and friends on a Thursday at 6:30 and enjoyed the vibe they were going for. It was an iconic scene for sure. We were greeted by someone who taught us how to order and to get in line. Shortly after, a waitress greeted us and explained the menu. We also got to sample a cucumber slice while we were in line. You order and then let them know where you'll be seating. I ordered a Great Leopold w/ chicken which tasted okay to me. I had to add some salt, but I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the pasta. It was a bit chewier than other places I've been to. I enjoyed the pasta my SO got, cacio e pepe with an addition of honey. The addition of honey was a nice balance to the heat and saltiness from the cheese! The base pasta price starts around 11-12 dollars and you can add additional items such as meat, egg yolk, honey, etc. You can definitely customize your dish to your liking. The food was a bit pricey IMO, but I definitely enjoyed the vibe and would come back to hang out with some friends.,This place truly embodies the uniqueness of Austin that attracts everyone to this fun city!

I ordered the half portion of the carbonara. It took a while for the pasta to come out but eventually it did. Traditionally for carbonara the raw egg is already mixed into the pasta but for this pasta the egg is just added on top. It looked delish! The pasta was decent. A bit too peppery for my liking but the pancetta in it was crispy and flavorful. The pasta was cooked Al dente and the sauce was creamy. Overall okay. Not the best but not the worst. I do think for some reason the raw egg made my stomach upset later on in the night.,Located in the butterfly bar we were excited to try some good pastas! I ordered the half portion of the carbonara.

I love this place - it's the perfect place to come out for a date or a night out with friends as it's laid back. For my entree, I got the Cacio e Pepe and added honey for an extra $1 and WOW. This was sooo good. Easily some of the best pasta I've had. There was a lot of flavor - very cheesy and creamy. The added honey was the perfect choice and I recommend that as well as it added a nice sweet spin on it. The portion was a good size too! I also got the Bruschetta which came with 3 different types: cheese, tomato, and tomato puree. These were nice to snack on and went well with the creamy pasta.

    ",Odd Duck,"This was easily one of the best places I have eaten in my life. This farm-to-table, sustainable, organic-when-possible, restaurant was the full package, and if I could have given them 6 stars I would have. Everything from the ambiance, to the service (Brandon and Zach were awesome!), to the well thought out menu was outstanding. ,The menu is designed so you order several small plates for your table to share. Each plate was an average of $12-$15, with the fried quail being the most expensive item at $20. Our group of three ordered 4 plates (5 was recommended for 3 people), and we left full, satisfied, and with our tastebuds happily buzzing with all of the amazing and unique flavors of our meal.,Each component of each dish worked together beautifully, and enticed the palate with salty/sweet/acid/creamy/savory all at once. When the dishes came out, they were colorful and plated beautifully in an unpretentious way, yet it was shocking how good they were... from the first to the last bite it was mind blowing.,The decor is farm-chic, with mason jars full of yummy pickled things lining the shelves, and cute mismatched plates you would find in your grandma's house. It feels modern, open, and fresh. ,I live in San Diego and will make the trip to Austin again just to eat here.,This was easily one of the best places I have eaten in my life.

With that said, I do think the food is generally over priced and be mindful . . .  the portions are small. I'm not kidding. ,When we sat down with a group of four, the waiter indicated the food was communal in the sense that it's meant to be shared amongst the group. He suggested we should order 6-12 dishes per couple, which I felt was excessive--particularly given each plate is approximately 10-15 dollars. I generally love the idea of sharing food, however, this was one of those places I left hungrier than when I arrived! ,Coincidentally, they advertise themselves as ""A Place To Share Food, Drink & Hospitality"" which is absolutely true, but they really should include a disclaimer that you'll be out a couple hundred bucks before your feeling that hospitality. ,In short, this is indeed a cool place to hit up. In fact, I would recommend coming here on a week day and having a drink accompanied with a few happy hour food items to try it out. ,Cheers.,The food is good, but just maybe slightly overrated.,The restaurant itself is ""on fleek"" (architecture + chic + cool).

Little did we know that they are by the same chef and we were so excited! Both restaurants food and flavors were absolutely delicious.,All the plates were delicious - our favorite was the quail over this delicious pancake with sweet paste? My only complaint is that the plates were small thus most things are family style and leaving you wanting more of that dish. ,Pro tip: bring in your barley swine receipt for 10% off your odd duck check,My friends and I dined at Barley and Swine the night before and had planned to go to Odd Duck the following morning for brunch.

They're very busy so make sure you make reservations before hand.,My favorite brunch dish is the grilled quail, the meat is extremely tender and juicy that goes very well with the cheese cream. This is served on a buttermilk pancake also, excellent choice.,My second favorite dish is the breakfast burger, this is probably the only dish that is big enough for one person.,Most of their dishes are so small that you would need at least 5-6 dishes for a group of 4.,Omg best place for brunch here.

During our quick trip to Austin, we chose Odd Duck to be our ""more expensive"" meal in the midst of all the BBQ and tacos. The glowing reviews certainly set the bar pretty high, but I loved every part of this restaurant! I booked an online reservation a few weeks in advance for the Happy Hour because of the discounted prices on some of the dishes. Odd Duck regularly updates its menus based on what's in season, so some of the dishes we got aren't on the menu anymore.,When we arrived, we were seated immediately. Our waitress was super sweet and gave us great suggestions on what to order. ,Redfish Ceviche was originally $14 and discounted to $7 for HH. This very fresh redfish was served with cilantro, lime, olive, squash curry, chips. At first, I thought potato chips seemed out of place with a ceviche kinda dish, but it worked! Added such a great crunch factor to a delicious dish. 5 stars!,Roasted Sweet Potatoes $5 from $10 with currant-onion preserve, capers, pecan, spicy chevre. This was a pretty big portion for the price! Loved how the tanginess of the goat cheese complemented the crunch of the pecans and soft sweet potatoes. Yum, such a great side! 5 stars!,Antelope Tataki $12 served with rosemary black pepper cracker, green garlic aioli, sesame. This portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but this dish packed a great punch! Loved the seasoning on this dish, and the antelope didn't taste gamey at all. 4.5 stars!,Oven Roasted Quail with oyster stuffing, greens, beans, crispy onion $23. I LOVED the oyster stuffing in this dish!! Super flavorful and worked very well with the tender quail. 4.5 stars!,Paloma was the drink special of the day! Very refreshing and stronger than I expected it to be! Loved the salt foam on the drink!,When our check arrived, we were shocked. A meal like this in many other places would easily be $50+ a person, but we ended up paying about ~$35 a person, which is super reasonable! If you're on the fence about making a reservation here, do it! What's stopping you from enjoying the best meal in Austin?,Omigosh Odd Duck was incredible!

Everything we ordered is absolutely delicious and the service is impeccable! I originally wanted to dine here on my birthday, but the hours I wanted were full, therefore, we came later during the week with reservations at 945pm for a party of 3 on Friday night. It's best to make reservations at least 1 week ahead of time if you really want the appropriate dinner hours. ,My sister is lactose intolerant and cannot have any dairy. Our server made sure any milk or butter was put to the side and substituted as needed. Our beet salad come with bleu cheese and was put in a separate bowl to the side. The antelope tataki is normally paired with buttered chips, but she added tortilla chips. I love how great and accommodating the servers were. Each one of them are also knowledgeable of the menu and each ingredient that dies in each dish. Our server described each dish and taste to the T! When ordering the antelope, we were afraid it would taste gamey, but she assured us it wouldn't. Lo and behold, she's right and it's delicious! ,I recommend anyone to dine here if you get a chance! They also valet your vehicle free of charge so you don't have to worry about parking. Tip them of course, they're only running to get your car.,This tapas restaurant is one of a kind!

Top shelf old fashioned was gorgeously balanced and had the most beautiful clear square ice cube right in the middle. Lovely drink - and old-fashioneds are not at all my favorite. And the smoked tomato bloody mary made me want to design a smoked mix at home. That element added so much. I am already a basic bloody mary fan, but this really blew me away. ,But the food. We got the bavette steak, biscuit with black garlic butter, pepper, pickled onions, oyster mushrooms, poached egg. The pickled onions and mushrooms (also soaked through with some kind of pungent vinegary flavor) did not belong. Garlic butter was fine because garlic butter, but it couldn't save the dry biscuit. Steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare, but it was just six bites topped with microgreens. Hm. Nothing stood out and the whole dish felt like it was trying too hard. ,Breakfast burger was just okay. The pretzel bun was delicious and sturdy. Beef was fresh ground but poorly seasoned. Hot sauce aioli was tasty but too heavily applied. Potato chips on bottom were unnecessary. Lost in the mix. As were the greens. But the egg was cooked perfectly, and that's always a welcome addition to any burger.,It wasn't my order, but I also tasted the sweet potato tater tots with pesto and pickled mustard seed. Nice creative attempt. But nothing that I will remember in a few month's time.,Bottom line: it's not that that any of the food was bad, not by a long shot. Everything was good. And yes, all the ingredients are local and fresh. Yay for that. But I hate paying this kind of premium for stuff I can make at home for far less cost and more to our tastes. I cannot reconcile that in my head.,I do have to note that service was outstanding. Definitely brings my rating up.

We loved it so much we ordered two!  We also had the seared antelope, so mild in flavor and pairs wonderfully with crackers with grains. The fish head (probably scary for most people) was perfectly fried and mixed with a delicious sauce. Mad props for a restaurant who uses all parts of an animal :). Lastly, the not your average chocolate cake!!! Super chocolatey and moist with a delicious sweet potato custard and crunchy sweet potato chips! Who would have thought! So yes, any food you get here is amazeballs. ,Service is on point. Everyone helps each other out and they don't skip a beat. Thank you all for the recommendations and helpful hints it really made our stay that much more enjoyable!,The decor is prefect for this restaurant. It's cute and awfully chic. Right by the bar there's large pickled vegetable vessels that help bring brightness and nature into the kitchen. ,This place left me wanting for more .,This restaurant was an absolute gem and a must go! ,I loved everything from the food to the service to the decor.

Everything is meant to be shared so if that's not for you don't come here. They use a lot of different vegetables and meats and sort of different takes on every sort of meal. Very fresh and service was good. They also have specials not on the menu so ask your server and certain things will also run out.,Enjoyed this restaurant.

There's a good a amount of parking and valet parking available, but this place can get busy especially for dinner. The menu here regularly changes since they use ingredients from local Austin farms. Odd duck also has a separate menu for vegetarians so make sure to ask for this if you are! ,I have to start with dessert since this was what made me love this place! The carrot cake spiced donuts where oh so crunchy on the outside but still soft on the inside. The ice cream was a perfect combination with these donuts. I would honestly come back here just for this but sadly it may not be there the next time I'm back. ,The rest of the food was great and I definitely want to try the rest of the food, especially as it changes with the seasons. All the food is perfectly shareable so make sure to come with a group of people! The server we had was also super attentive and friendly and was able to answer all of our questions. I highly recommend Odd Duck to all those in Austin.,Had an amazing lunch with one of my best friends here.

We came for dinner for a party of two. ,The service was fast and they did a great job communicating between the kitchen, staff, and servers. Our server (and even the ones dropping off food at our table) was very personable with plenty of great recommendations and just the right amount of attentiveness for our table. We ordered a bottle of wine, which is half off on Sundays! We then proceeded to order: ,Redfish ceviche - OMG YOU WILL REGRET NOT ORDERING THIS. You would not think this would be a good combination but the fresh ceviche paired with squash curry, which added that tang, was so flavorful. The brightness from the lime and crunch from the chips were crucial to tie everything together. We actually ordered another one since we we flabbergasted at how good it was. ,The Antelope Tataki is more on the mild side compared to the ceviche but I enjoyed the novelty of trying a meat I don't find often on restaurant menus. The meat and the slaw paired surprisingly well on the sesame crackers.,We ordered the chicken fried fish head per the servers recommendation. It was quite impressive looking and maybe a little intimidating. It was very flavorful but does require a lot of work. Once you are almost done you will find yourself looking for more morsels of deliciousness. ,Everything we ordered was a surprise to our tastebuds.

The staff is very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about their food and drinks.,Delicious, but only if you're willing to be adventurous!,I came here with a group of four on a weekday and got seated very quickly.  The ambiance was very relaxed and all of the waiters/waitresses were super friendly and kept our waters filled the entire time.  They were also very open about how many dishes we should order for our group and that gave us a great idea of what to order.  When getting small plates, it's really hard to judge just how much you should get.,We started off with their sourdough bread which came out fresh and warm with some butter.  Then they brought out our order of carrots, lemon curd, dill gremolata, curry peanuts, radish with our order of seeded pretzel sticks with aerated squash queso.  Both were delicious.  They provided us more than enough squash queso and we loved it so much that we ordered MORE sourdough bread so we could keep dipping (though honestly, I may have had some without dipping into anything because it was just that good).,After that they brought out the Pinto falafel fritters, Antelope tataki, and Grilled quail.  Having never had antelope before, I was definitely intrigued by the antelope tataki.  Within our group it was a bit hit or miss, but I loved it.  Of everything we ordered, though, the pinto falafel fritters were my personal favorite.,Finally, they ended with the Shrimp salad which came with a latke, which was definitely delicious, but by this point I was getting full!,The price for what we got, with the quality of food in mind, was definitely worth it, though it is a bit on the pricier side of a casual restaurant.  But again, definitely well worth it.,All in all, I would recommend Odd Duck to anyone that is willing

By the time we leave though, the place is packed and the parking lot is full (free valet but tips are encouraged). ,All the ingredients are locally sourced so the menu is changing frequently. In addition to fresh ingredients, there are options to make our burgers customizable: how you want your meat cooked, any & all dietary restrictions, or if you really wanted to customize it with say, a fried egg, you can do that as well.,The Burger ($19) includes chili, beer cheese (I got mine on the side), a crunchy tostada, slaw with red cabbage, and crispy green leaf lettuce. I chose mine with a medium-rare and it was perfect. What I loved a lot was the tostada crisp giving extra texture to each bite and the fluffy sesame seed bun. ,If I were back for dinner I'd also like to check out the bar area for a closer look at the barrel aged cocktails.,As the quest for the best burger continues, the next stop brings us to Odd Duck.

Everything is gluten free,,corn free, and I think soy free as well. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options as well. Total quality food. ,The service is always great and the atmosphere is bright and clean and trendy. Drinks are yum--my favorite is the berry basic booch. And my food is almost always great. There has only been few cases where it hasn't met my expectations (bad avocado once, meh salad another time, etc). But it's been very few times. ,I love this place but the only reason I gave it four stars is because it just feels you pay too much. Like I get it's Austin and it's quality food but it's so expensive and a lot of the plates aren't the biggest portions. Like the vegan queso--amazing and delicious but you get like 7 chips with it, and then have to pay if you want more. It just seems like it's not always worth what you pay. And its not like SO good that I'd pay so much for it too often. So it just isn't 5 stars for me. But it is a really solid restaurant and great place to go for many occasions.

I placed a to go order for chicken strips and a salad.,When I got there, the place looked really nicely decorated and had a good atmosphere. I went to pay for my order and was quoted $28. I was flabbergasted. How can a salad and some chicken strips cost more than a BBQ dinner? ,I didn't say anything and got the food anyway. The food was very good and the flavors were great. However the portions and what I got wasnt justified by the price. I wanted to like this place but the prices are just too outrageous to continue to go there. I know this isn't the case for everyone and more power to you, but if I'm going to spend upwards of $30 for a meal, I want it to be special and filling.,I found this place randomly yesterday and thought what an amazing place to not have to worry about any gluten cross contaminated foods.

I mean I have never found a place so accommodating to the keto, paleo, and gluten free lifestyle. I had the almond flour chips with the cashew queso and guacamole for a buck(about a tbs of guac) it was a nice substitute to the real thing. I then ordered,The crispy chicken skin off the special diet menu and it came with more green veggies. Although I did not eat the butter nut squash because I'm trying to stay low carb I really did enjoy the meal. The seating staff and our waiter was awesome. Even moving us to a better table when it opened up. I even watched the waiter chase someone out the door when thier mate forgot their key. I don't live here but this place would make sticking it to my diet so much easier.,Okay I selected this place after I read almond flour chips!!!

Frothy, creamy, silky rich, and caffeine-free as well. The ample dusting of cinnamon is a nice touch. ,Chicken tenders at happy hour are amazing - crispy, seasoned well, and even tastier after being dunked in a tangy honey mustard aioli. Almond flour chips in the loaded guacamole appetizer are like crack. ,Breakfast tacos are hearty, the rainbow salad is vibrant and refreshing. The Picnik cobb is my favorite, with its medley of chicken tenders, avocado, tomato, and bacon. I saw someone eye my plate one time and he promptly ordered the salad as well.,The Bad:,Picnik is very, very expensive for what you get. Since it's already so hard to find places that are gluten/dairy-free, I allow myself to enjoy food here and come if I can. Not that Picnik's food is bad. It's delicious! But it is very expensive. A breakfast taco is $6-7. Picnik cobb is $19. It's too much, if I'm being honest. But I mostly come for breakfast and happy hour, and that helps a lot.,The muffins are delicious and they have lots of flavors (banana nut, apple cinnamon, lemon poppyseed), but they're probably the least bang for your buck because they're miniscule and cost $3 each.,I used to hate on Picnik because it was expensive and touted trendy foods, but because I had to go through drastic diet changes and cut out gluten/dairy....Picnik is now one of my favorites. ,The Good:,Their chai is the stuff of dreams.

A friend and I wanted to grab nice casual dinner somewhere and because everyone raves about PICNIK I decided to check it out. ,The positive: hip, cool, great service, good for health issues like gluten sensitivities and ketogenic needs.,The negatives: overpriced (like 20 dollars for curry with chicken, not including rice or the chicken!!!!) and 14 dollar tacos, oh lord, and the food tastes bad, simply bad. ,So as you probably guessed, we got the fish tacos and the Thai red curry. I can make a pot of curry for 3 that is gluten free, vegan and organic for the price I was charged, probably even less. (Simplythai kits from the farmers market hint hint) The veggies were not properly cooked and the sauce lacked that true curry taste you get from Thai curry. It tasted like boiled potato and carrots that got tossed in packaged sauce. The fish tacos were like handfuls of battered fish on siete tortillas. The tortillas were already falling apart and unable to hold up and actually qualify as tacos. I was so turned off by the meal that we asked for a refund which I never do! Luckily we got it hence the 2 stars. Overall, it's cool being organic and healthy but if you're gonna charge prices like that the food has to be good. Sway has curry of a similar price and it tastes 100 times better than what I had. Word of advice to health fanatics that love this place for health needs. Go to Whole Foods and buy canned organic curry sauce and cut up your own veggies. Ps: you can also get siete tortillas there and cook them yourself. ,On a side note: what made me remember to write this review is the law suit going on with bento picnic, you're a huge restaurant with products in Whole Foods and you're picking on a small restaurant that has picnic in its name? Shame on you.  You make enough money with the prices on your menu!,So I tried PICNIK a couple of months ago on a rainy day and finally had the time to write a review.

I enjoyed the variety of green veggies (broccolini, snap,peas, asparagus, and kale), and the chiles definitely provided a heat punch! The whipped goat cheese added a creamy texture and tangy taste when combined with the omelette. The muffin was tasty as well, the apple flavor pulled through and it wasn't overly sweet which I prefer. Portion size can seem somewhat small, but I was sufficiently full afterwards. ,Came here for a weekend brunch, and it wasn't too crowded. Our large group was seated shortly and the overall service was great. The interior is bright and beautifully decorated in a contemporary, hipster way. There's a a few spots directly in front of Picnik and shared parking lot in the back, but I can imagine it can get dicey during busy times. Picnik is on the pricier side (my meal was approximately $20 with tax and tip), but I believe the high-quality ingredients justify this. ,Overall, I would come back!,Picnik offers high-quality food for all conscious eaters! ,Ordered the Pesto and Goat Cheese scramble and seasonal Apple Crumble muffin.

All of them were delicious, but Mayan mocha was by far the most unique and flavorful. It's a must try! ,The food was also great, but the portion sizes are mediocre for the price of all of the food. I have been before and ordered the sweet potato hash, which is still my favorite dish there. This time I tried the pesto eggs goat cheese dish. Although I enjoyed it, I would not order it again. ,The service was pleasant and prompt. Overall, a great experience, but I was left still wanting more food and I don't usually feel that way after meals.

The restaurant has a hippie twist to it. Their coffees all have butter in them, which reminded me of a keto type diet. I was intrigued. I ordered an iced vanilla latte, which was an astounding $7 considering the latte itself was not that big. I definitely tasted the butter in the coffee. The latte tasted like your average latte but with melted butter in it. It was good, but I don't think I'd pay $7 for it again. 10 hours later and I still feel like I downed a stick of butter. Keeps you full, at least. ,For brunch, I ordered the avocado toast and added an egg and bacon. I enjoyed it a lot, but since the entire restaurant is gluten-free, the bread tasted a little different than your normal bread. It was very dense and sourdough-y, but it worked. The avocado on the toast was puree-like, and the egg was perfectly poached. It was definitely a filling meal. ,I also tried the fried brussel sprouts with pork belly, which was delicious. The flavors were good, the brussel sprouts had a good crunchy texture, and the pork belly was well cooked. ,Overall, prices were a bit hefty, but I did enjoy the atmosphere and the food!,This is a cute place that certainly has that  Austin-aesthetic-brunch vibe.

I even checked it def not mine. Showed it to the waiter and he winced. I got the bill and he charged me for it. It's cool I was going to tip him The cost for the entire taco ($6.95) if he took it off but he didn't so he's just gonna get the 18% which is half of that.

Reasonably priced food for conscious eaters and those with food allergies or dietary preferences either vegan, gluten free, low carb can certainly find a good item on the menu. Their gluten free bread is dangerous though! If you lack self control don't even order it ;).,Last time I visited finally tried their vegan queso and it was amazing! I love the tex mex creation but it's usually followed by long periods of over eating regrets, so this is close to perfect and the almond flour chips are amazing.,*** I do have a few thing to complain about and it's primarily the lack of boldness in the menu. As much as I love the simplicity on it, there are ways to make something good great. The salads are on the VERY bland side and I probably won't order any of them again. The rainbow chopped salad is one of the least enjoyable meals I've had and I just ate it because I knew it was good for me, but the tahini lemon dressing lacks tahini and lemon! Nevermind salt and some  oil to emulsify the dryness of it and be a better complement to the bitterness of some of the ingredients, additionally the over cooked and underseasoned salmon either grilled or blackened!  These are minor complaints that don't take away many of the great quality items on their menu, but will hopefully improve over time. I'll definitely keep coming back.,Picnik is one of a kind in the Austin's food scene.

I love the tex mex creation but it's usually followed by long periods of over eating regrets, so this is close to perfect and the almond flour chips are amazing.,*** I do have a few thing to complain about and it's primarily the lack of boldness in the menu. As much as I love the simplicity on it, there are ways to make something good great. The salads are on the VERY bland side and I probably won't order any of them again. The rainbow chopped salad is one of the least enjoyable meals I've had and I just ate it because I knew it was good for me, but the tahini lemon dressing lacks tahini and lemon! Nevermind salt and some  oil to emulsify the dryness of it and be a better complement to the bitterness of some of the ingredients, additionally the over cooked and underseasoned salmon either grilled or blackened!  These are minor complaints that don't take away many of the great quality items on their menu, but will hopefully improve over time. I'll definitely keep coming back."

    ",Franklin Barbecue,"I had read about this place and honestly had no idea what to expect. We were unexpectedly surprised and had a great time. With that being said, we did wait 5 1/2 hours for food but we expected that up front. ,Everyone was super friendly and we made friends with the people in line and drank all morning in the parking lot until we got to the counter. ,The BBQ is on point! I am extremely picky about the kind of BBQ I like and this was some of the best I have ever had. We got the brisket, a beef rib, sausage and pulled pork. We also ordered beans and coleslaw. I could have gone without the pulled pork, it wasn't anything spectacular. The sausages were good but not my favorite. The beef rib was ridiculously tender and delicious. The pork ribs fell off the bone and were very tasty. I'm not a big fan of brisket and I thought it was very good. The baked beans were amazing and the coleslaw was refreshing. Overall a great experience.,I had read about this place and honestly had no idea what to expect. We were unexpectedly surprised and had a great time.

Sunscreen and water. Bring a book or go with friends. Just be prepared to wait. If you can come 6am or earlier, you would be closer to the front of the line. That day I asked the people at the very front of the line what time they came. They said 4:45am. Think of it like a tailgate. ,They open at 11 and close until they sell out, around 2ish. ,If you know six weeks or so in advance that you will come here, so preorder online.

Surprisingly, there was only brisket, sliced or chopped, when we got to the counter. No pork or sausage or anything else. We got plenty of brisket and potato salad for the six of us, and the brisket was delicious and moist. I ended up sandwiching slices between wonder bread with raw sliced onion. However, the potato salad was the worst I've ever eaten. All we could taste was dill pickles. It needed sugar and salt and less vinegar. There was no balance of flavor at all. I couldn't even taste potato, just pickles. We collectively agreed it wasn't good and left a lot of it untouched. The sauces on the table were nothing special and I ended up not using them.,Considering the wait, the brisket was good but I expected so much more. I can name at least two equally good places in Houston for brisket, Killens and Truth, and their sides are far superior.

It had great flavor and an amazing snap to it. We had the fatty and lean brisket. I thought both options were just as good but felt like the rub was a little salty. The bbq sauces were good but too vingeary to our liking.,Glad we were able to try this place but bummed out they were out of ribs. Probably would not wait another 3.5 hours to eat here again though.

But it was still pretty good brisket.,I came in with the expectation that there was going to be a huge wait. It is, after all, Franklin Barbecue. What I wasn't anticipating was the crazy long line of over a hundred people at 9am on a Wednesday. I should've just come an hour earlier, so that's my bad.,TIPS FOR YOUR VISIT,- Come extra early. This sounds like a complete ""duh,"" but seriously, just come earlier than you think you need to. You're going to end up waiting forever anyway, so might as well get there earlier so you can stay out of the sun.,- Underneath their stairway, Franklin provides a ton of complimentary foldable chairs that you can just grab and use while you wait. At a certain point, a worker will start handing out umbrellas to protect you from the sun--wear a ton of sunscreen anyway.,- There's complimentary water up the stairs. Stay hydrated.,THE FOOD,Caveat: As someone who didn't grow up eating much American BBQ, I can't say that I have a deep appreciation for it, so take that for what it's worth. If given the option between American BBQ and Asian-style BBQ (e.g., Korean BBQ, Japanese yakiniku, etc.), I'd opt for an Asian-style BBQ 9 times out of 10.,Complimentary Beef Sandwich: While we were waiting in line, one of the workers handed out samples of shredded beef in a piece of white bread. I'm not one to turn down anything free, so naturally, I took one. Unfortunately, it didn't make the best first impression on me, as the flavor was a little sharp and the meat was rather dry. Still a nice gesture.,Brisket: Very flavorful bark and extremely tender, juicy, fatty interior. The BBQ sauces on the side were also very well-balanced and nuanced.,Sausage Links: The flavor profile and texture were a little surprising. I can't say that I'm a huge fan. Looking at the inside of the sausage, it's clear that there was a lot of care put into the custom mix; however, the end product just didn't impress me.,I would have ordered more, but I unfortunately had to rush to the airport. Another ""duh"" protip: don't go to Franklin when you're expecting to travel around lunchtime. Be a better planner than I was.,THE OPERATION,As someone who highly values efficiency, I must say waiting at Franklin is the ultimate test of patience. The wait is frustrating not necessarily because of how long it is but because of how inefficient the process is.,From the entrance of the restaurant to the ordering counter, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. How is that possible? Because there's only one person cutting and weighing the meat at the counter. ONE PERSON.,They could hire more than one person to work the counter (since all of the product is ready to go), but that would make too much sense. I cannot wrap my head around what they get out of being this inefficient. They sell out no matter what; why not just sell out faster so everyone can go home an hour or two earlier (and happier)? There is no respectable justification for how slow-moving the line is. They simply don't give a fuck about making you wait.,OVERALL,Was it an experience? Certainly. Was the experience worth it? I mean... I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone begged me.

Franklin's was my first stop after getting off the plane. There was a line and I did not get my food until a little after 12:00. Which is not too bad. I used a ride share app for my arrival, but it seems there is ample parking in the area. ,Service: All of the staff was pleasant. They allow you inside to get water or to buy beer or soft drinks. They come around prior to opening to get a count of what you would to order. This is how they let people know if they have enough. They are swift about cleaning off tables when someone leaves and frequently offer assistance. I truly appreciated this from the staff. ,Food: You order a la carte and as a single diner this can add up if you wish to try different things. I ordered a Tipsy Texan, .5 pound of brisket both lean/fatty mix, .5 pound of ribs. My bill came to around 37.00 including my beverage. I did not get sides as the sandwich has coleslaw on it. I did not get a sausage because it also on the Tipsy Texan. The Tipsy Texan is a great deal. You get brisket slaw and sausage. I highly recommend it. The ribs were ok. Not the best I have had. The brisket was really good. However, I did go to La Barbecue later in the day and I liked the brisket better there. I wanted to compare the two. I don't know if I will ever visit Austin again so I wanted to visit both. It is hard to give fair judgment after one visit. Maybe they just had a better day. Franklin's has three sauces to choose from. I preferred the darker sauce that has like an espresso flavor and the sauce that had more of a vinegar base.  I enjoyed the experience. I think it is an experience if you are in the Austin area. I doubt if I return and stand in a three hour line, but now I can say I have had Franklin's Barbecue.,I went on a Wednesday and arrived around 9:00am. I did a fly-in - fly-out day in Austin.

We were recommended to this place by multiple friends and it did not disappoint. ,Our Air BnB was just up the street so we walked over there on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm. We were sad to see a ""sold out"" sign on their front door but noticed there were people still in line. We still went in and stepped in line. The staff was super friendly and mentioned to us that they were sold out of mostly all their staples except the sausage and chipped brisket. For it being our first time we still wanted to try it and avoid waiting in a 5 hour line. ,We waited for about 10 min before we got to the front of the line. Yeah....10 minutes only. So if you really want to beat the lines and are okay with only trying the brisket and some sides it's worth it. ,Once we got to the serve counter. The server asked us how many people were in our party, we said three and he made us a plate of the following: ,- sausage, chopped brisket, coleslaw, potato salad, onions, pickles, and sliced bread ,- 2 beers ,Our bill came out to only $26. Which we were all in shock about. For it being the end of the day they gave us a great price and it was still very very good!! One of the best BBQ spots we've ever had. Bummed out we did not get to try the ribs, but there's always a next time.,All in all if you don't want to wait in the crazy line, stop by later in the afternoon for a hell of a deal on quality BBQ. Also don't be discouraged if they have a ""sold out"" sign, stop in a see what they have left.,As everyone knows Franklin BBQ is a staple when visiting Austin. We were recommended to this place by multiple friends and it did not disappoint. ,Our Air BnB was just up the street so we walked over there on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm.

The wait wasn't bad compared to the horror stories I've heard and the food was quite delicious.,We ordered the brisket, ribs, turkey, and sausage. I thought the sausage was the best thing out of everything we've eaten though the ribs were a close second. To be honest, I thought the food was pretty neck and neck with La Barbecue but the aforementioned does not have as long as a line and bomb sides.,Despite the wait, the experience was great! It seemed like an Austin staple and I don't regret going at all. The staff was very friendly and there was free water for all to enjoy. I also quite appreciated that there was a person who came out to the line and made sure to take a head count of who was all there so that people did not wait in line for no reason.,We went on a Tuesday around 9:30 am and were able to eat by 12:30pm.

So much so that people are willing to wait 5 hours for it (people is me. I am people). ,Let me start by saying the food isn't worth the wait. The sauce is very vinegar-y and if you don't get there at the crack of dawn you don't get to taste what you really come for.,The brisket was amazing, nice and tender. Could have used more seasoning but i did NOT need to ass BBQ sauce (which is important). The sausage was the best meat we had. Potato wasn't good at all; way too much vinegar or mustard, too tangy. ,The experience was amazing though. Hot, but fun. I would recommend just for the experience but i won't be back to wait in that long line for the food.,There is a big hype behind this establishment.

They are very helpful, informative and always have a smile. Shout out to Julie and to my dude that brought out the green and khaki caps. I thank you all for your hard work!!- AyeAyeronn give these guys a raise.,So travelled from NYC strictly for Franklins, stayed at an airbnb right behind Franklins. ,I was determined to be no. 1, have been told the day before that someone had lined up at 5 am. No worries, i got this. ,It was Saturday, beef ribs day and i will not be denied. Woke up at 4:25am , stood on the porch looking as a couple of cars pulled into the lot. No worries, might be employees arriving early, then there it was.... i saw a cooler come out, at that moment I knew no.1 spot was gone. I picked up my rocking chair, yes an effing rocking chair, if am waiting, am going to wait in style, and ran ok, ok fast walked towards the line. I was no. 4 that day because someone was there at 2:30 am!!!!,Time flew as all of us bonded over the love of bbq and food in general. My friend woke up few hours later and offered coffee from the pot to people on line. ,The food...ordered 3 beef ribs, 1/4 pulled pork, turkey, 1lb pork ribs, 1 sausage link and a whole brisket minus the lean part. Nobody got time for the lean part, as Ivan Drago says in rocky, ""if he dies, he dies"". Also pre-ordered another whole brisket and full slab of ribs.  Don't judge me, i was bringing it back to NYC. ,The taste.....perfectly balanced flavor on the brisket, so soft that they should just ghead and get rid of those plastic knives. ,Beautifully cooked with a nice bark. Will come back for this alone. ,Beef ribs was falling off the dinosaur bones, juicy and moist . I highly recommend coming on a Saturday to get some. ,Pork ribs had good flavor and bite tender, nothing spectacular like the two above. ,The rest was just ok - would pass on those.  ,If you want to try the brisket, just pre order, you can eat without the line. You want beef ribs, you will have to line up. ,Made great friends lining up but next time i will just pre-order for the brisket.i,First off, i would like to commend all the staff that works at Franklins Bbq.

We had an incredible BBQ the night before at Salt Lick and wanted to see if Franklin really lived up to the hype. Spoiler alert, it did! But I probably wouldn't wait in the line again. We arrived at 9am on a Tuesday and there was a small line of people forming already. By 10am the line was pretty long already. Most people bring chairs since the wait is long, but the restaurant also provides some lawn chairs for people to borrow. The wait honestly isn't bad because people play music, drink beer, and talk to each other. The staff members will come around at 10:30ish to start taking orders to see how much food will be left for others.,When it was finally 11am, the restaurant opened and they passed out samples of a variety of meats in line! Trying those samples made our decision so much harder, but we ended up going with Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Ribs, as well as a Pecan Pie. They slice the meat in front of you and basically everyone's mouths were watering. We sat down with our huge platter and excitedly dug in. I'm normally a brisket gal, but THOSE RIBS were mouth-watering, incredibly delicious! So tender and basically fell apart. The Brisket was super delicious too but overshadowed by the Ribs for me. Pulled Pork was dry and kinda average so I wouldn't get that again. We were stuffed to the brim after this meat feast, but the Pecan Pie offered some great sweet relief to our otherwise very savory meal. ,So glad I braved the wait for Franklin and got to experience what made Aaron Franklin so famous!,Did you even go to Austin if you didn't go to Franklin BBQ?

To be fair, we didn't get the ""full"" Franklin experience, because we pre-ordered our food so we didn't have to wait hours in line. There's 3 or so parking spots specifically reserved for pre-orders, right next to the trailer where they hand out the pre-orders. There are 3 large picnic tables you can sit at while you're waiting for your pre-order but you're not supposed to eat on the spot there. They cut your meat after you arrive, so you'll need to wait for a bit while they do so, but it's not too bad. Now, onto the meat:,Brisket: star of the menu. First bite tastes like heaven. Fatty meat that dissolves into your mouth like nothing I've ever tasted. 5/5,Ribs: nice sharp peppery taste to them, without being too overwhelming. Definitely has a fall-off-the-bone texture as the meat will quite literally fall off of your eating utensil if you try to use one to eat these (you should get your hands dirty for this). 4.8/5,Pulled pork: similar to the brisket in fatty quality, in my opinion. I liked the soft threads of pork juxtaposed against the crispy, bold flavor of the crust/top. 4.7/5,Sausage: really tasty, strong flavors-- even though it's ""just"" sausage. Overall, likely because of the type of meat/style of preparation, not as juicy as the other meats I had. 4.5/5,Sides were good but nothing too special compared to the meat. Overall, delicious and met my expectations. A true classic to try if you're ever in Austin.,Visited the legendary Franklin BBQ for some high quality Texas meat and was not disappointed.

We were 15th in line. #1 got there at 5:15am.  There is covered space for around 70 or so people. Line went down the block and around the corner of the parking lot.  Over 100+ people in line easy by the time 11am hit.  They came around 8:30am and got everyone's tentative order so they could let people further back in line know what would probably be available once they were able to order.  Also, there is porta toilets in the parking lot, but after 8:30am they open the restaurant for people to use the restroom and grab a cup of ice water. Also you can buy beverages, beer and soda, and merch during this time as well.  Once 11am hit they opened the door. It was like being a little kid again at the amusement park. So excited. Lol.  We got our food and sat down by 11:30.   ,Food:  Fatty brisket is the way to go.  Almost melts in your mouth. So rich and heavy but so good.  Pork ribs were one bite away from falling off the bone. Sausage is good. Coarse grind and great snap to it.  Pinto beans were good with a nice kick. I didn't try any other sides. Also, didn't use bbq sauce because this is Central Texas BBQ and I wanted to experience the meat as Aaron presented it to us. ,Overall great experience.  It's tailgating for bbq and it was a good time that flew by because there was a sense of BBQ camaraderie with others enduring the wait. Worth the wait to experience at least once.  Brisket and ribs are great enough to warrant the wait.  One BBQ Mecca off the list on the next one.  Valentina's BBQ is next.,The Franklin BBQ experience.

So rich and heavy but so good.  Pork ribs were one bite away from falling off the bone. Sausage is good. Coarse grind and great snap to it.  Pinto beans were good with a nice kick. I didn't try any other sides. Also, didn't use bbq sauce because this is Central Texas BBQ and I wanted to experience the meat as Aaron presented it to us. ,Overall great experience.  It's tailgating for bbq and it was a good time that flew by because there was a sense of BBQ camaraderie with others enduring the wait. Worth the wait to experience at least once.  Brisket and ribs are great enough to warrant the wait.  One BBQ Mecca off the list on the next one.  Valentina's BBQ is next.,The Franklin BBQ experience. Got in line at 6:45am. We were 15th in line. #1 got there at 5:15am.  There is covered space for around 70 or so people. Line went down the block and around the corner of the parking lot.  Over 100+ people in line easy by the time 11am hit.  They came around 8:30am and got everyone's tentative order so they could let people further back in line know what would probably be available once they were able to order.  Also, there is porta toilets in the parking lot, but after 8:30am they open the restaurant for people to use the restroom and grab a cup of ice water.

Do it once to experience the food or just pre order and save the hassle.,Fatty brisket. Faatttyyyyyyyyyy brisket. Everything else are just side dishes.,Fatty brisket.,Is it worth the wait? Yes.

Do it once to experience the food or just pre order and save the hassle.,Fatty brisket. Faatttyyyyyyyyyy brisket. Everything else are just side dishes.,Fatty brisket.,One word ... WOW! ,Without a question, the best barbecue food that we have ever had anywhere in the country (including Texas, Kansas City, St. Louis, North and South Carolina). Few restaurants in this world meet or exceed the hype bestowed upon them and Franklin blows by all expectations.,Prior to our visit to Franklin, we did some research on the best days and times to arrive so we can get our meat fill on, and I would highly recommend you do the same. The stories are real and the line DOES start early, even on the ""least"" popular days, if there is one. We came by on a Tuesday morning at 8am, which actually wasn't that early, and we were the 20th and 21st people on the line. There were still plenty of parking spots in the parking lot in the back. Throughout our wait, the mood was actually very positive amongst everyone as we were all in the same boat and we engaged in some chit chat with fellow linemates. When ended up coming to know that the 1st person on the line had been there since 6:30am. Some might wonder what's the difference between #20 and #1, but #1 definitely has its perks as I will mention later on.,What really made the wait bearable was the fact that a staff member came out to greet everyone. On top of it, she informed all of us that they had foldable camping chairs for anyone who needed them and that their doors were already open to customers who needed to use the restrooms, get some water, take pictures or for anyone who wanted to buy any merchandise. As the opening time of 11am approached, the line grew exponentially to beyond the dine-in parking lot into the pre-order parking lot. A waitress actually came out to ask to gauge what everyone was going to order so that they knew what was going to run out by when. Bottom line, you can tell they knew the drill and were pros. FINALLY, the clock struck 11am and we all began filing in. The wait was over! There were very few times in my life I had felt this level of anticipation eating anywhere. Minus the dress code, I felt like I was about to walk into a landmark establishment the likes of The French Laundry. In fact, in their own realms, they are their own very special experiences.,Within about 20 minutes of stepping foot into what I would hope heaven is like, we had ordered our food. Being that it was our 1st and potentially only time visiting, we had no choice, but to go ALL OUT. The menu consisted of the typical meat by the pound option of brisket, pork ribs, sausage, turkey and pulled pork. There were also a few sandwiches and 3 sides offered, potato salad, slaw and pinto beans. So when I said we went all out, we held nothing back and ordered 1 lb of brisket, 1 lb of pork ribs, ¼ lb of turkey, ¼ lb of pulled pork and 2 sausage links. Whewwww. Also, we ordered a single potato salad, single slaw and single pinto beans. If that wasn't enough, we were sucked into also getting the bourbon banana tart pie for good measure.,As a side note, as we approached the counter to order, who else, but the man, the myth, the legend - THE Aaron Franklin - came out to greet and take photos with the 1st few parties that already got their food as they settled into their seats at tables. So, like I said, there was a major perk to being one of the first five parties in line.,OK, so the food? The food truly tasted different and better than any barbecue restaurant we had ever been to, period. The brisket was so fatty and juicy and the flavors with each bite hit the spot. It was remarkable how amazingly good it was compared to other renowned restaurants. The pork ribs were phenomenal. The seasoning on top of the skin was delicious and added a nice kick to it. The meat on the bones just fell right off with each bite of tender goodness. The pulled pork, which can sometimes be dry, was anything but that. There was so much flavor in it and I loved that it was just as juicy as anything we just ate. ,The one big surprise was the turkey. We typically shy away from chicken or turkey at because it's always dry, but my God. We couldn't believe how good it was. It was juicy and smothered in their oils. Lastly, if I had a knock on the restaurant, it would be the sausage. It was tasty and good, but it was a bit chewy on the outside. It was tougher than we thought, but nevertheless it was flavorful like everything else. And that bourbon banana tart pie? If you still have space in that every expanding stomach after this meal, get it! You won't regret it.,Was it worth the 3 hour wait we endured? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY. Typically, after such a large meal, I'm sick of that cuisine, but I wanted to come back the next day and have some more! Barbecue will just never be the same for us. When I say it was a special occasion, it truly was. The waiting, the service, the food. Everything about Franklin's is a perfect example of a well-oiled machine. Believe it or not, it was truly a life-changing food experience that will be etched in my mind for a long time - THAT'S HOW GOOD IT WAS.,One word ...

The drinks we had (hard lemonade and margaritas) were awesome so would come back again for drinks but unfortunately we were underwhelmed by the food.,The chicken fried steak was massive and comes with a side. We split this and added another side and still had left overs! The meat was pretty good quality but the batter was super thick and very bland. I honestly don't understand why they make it sound like it's the best thing on the menu.. I wouldn't order it again. Maybe the chicken fried steak is hyped up by visitors from out of state, I don't know lol, but as some one who was raised in a small town in Texas this wouldn't even be in my top 10 I've eaten. The garlic mashers on the other hand were definitely great and would recommend.,Maybe brunch is better?,So over ten different visits to Austin and I had always avoided one of the most reviewed restaurants in town. I guess it was finally time to see if it lived up to the hype. ,Upon arrival, you can clearly tell this place is popular as the line was out the door, but I think some of this may of been due to a conference nearby. Speaking of which, the conference center is right next door, so be aware of this especially towards the end of a day when many could be pouring out looking for food and or alcohol. Back to the initial arrival, I was told the wait would be long, but then moments later I was offered a spot at one of their smaller outside bars. I can honestly say this restaurant is strung into many micro lounge/eating areas. I was taken back as many areas could act as their own restaurant. Fast forward to the mini outdoor/indoor bar I was led to. Not a lot of room, but you should expect it when visiting Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill. The food menu is very simple, one sheet, hard to really mess this up. I had opted for their pork three ways sandwich (Pulled, smoked, whole), a side of sweet potato fries and a beer. Calorie counters stop reading now. When it came I was in for a doozy, as the serving size is quite large. The sandwich to the point was absolutely divine and one I would not mind eating every single day if it were not for diets! The beer and fries were nothing to write home about though, so a hard pass for those. Price point, it was pretty fair and the service was on point.,Was it worth it? Definitely, I could easily see myself returning the next time I visit Austin.,So over ten different visits to Austin and I had always avoided one of the most reviewed restaurants in town.

Undeterred we went to the bar area, got a pamosa for my wife, a Bloody Mary for me, and sodas for our boys. The Bloody Mary was perfect... spicy but not to much so, refreshing, and good sized with a baby corn, olive, pepper, and a celery stalk. It hit the spot.,About 45 mins into being here the buzzer for our table went off. That was a good thing because my boys were making plans to hijack the watermelon on the buffet table as it was.,We were seated outside on the patio... it was a beautiful morning... and the patio was perfect. We met our server, gave him a drink order and then hit the buffets. I ordered a signature Manhattan... it was stupendous! ,They have 3 stations/buffet tables, 1 sweets, and two savory. We of course went straight for the sweets! Come on... it's Father's Day!,I loaded up on the bread pudding, cranberry muffins, and a danish, my wife had the French toast and some fruit, while my boys destroyed the cinnamon rolls and the fruit. The bread pudding was phenomenal! Sweet, moist, and plentiful! I love a good bread pudding.,Next we hit the egg station... here there are many interesting combinations: eggs with bacon and potato, chorizo eggs, spinach, peppers and eggs, and so on, but no worries... if you are like my boys... they will make just plain scrambled eggs even though they are not out here on the buffet... just ask. (The eggs are ok) However on this station is also the chicken fried steak fingers, the chicken tenders, and the chipotle gravy and biscuits.... ohhhhh my Goddie, the gravy, was so tooooo Hottie!! It was great on the chicken, the steak fingers or the biscuits. I'll bet it would have been good on the French toast, the salads, or just about anything! It was so fantastic... yum yum YUMMMM!,The third station had sausage, candied yams, deviled eggs, and other savory treats... all of which were wonderful! ,If you go away hungry from this spread you only have yourself to blame! The food was amazing!,I highly recommend this location and brunch buffet... you will not be disappointed and it won't break your bank eating here either.,The most hellacious brunch buffet I have ever had!,For Father's Day my wife took us back to Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill for their signature brunch.,They have valet parking for $9.... soooo worth it!,Our family showed up at 10am, they opened at 9, and there was already an hour wait!

The decor was rustic and super cute. Water is served in Mason jars and they start you out with delicious buttery popcorn. We tried the chicken and waffles and the steak. They came with cornbread and we also ordered sweet potato fries. Everything was excellent. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because of the lack of parking. Otherwise awesome experience.,Loved this little place! The decor was rustic and super cute. Water is served in Mason jars and they start you out with delicious buttery popcorn.

We stopped by on a Friday night with hopes of getting a table. Of course being a Friday night there was about a hour and a half wait. Our party decided to go check out the bar. While waiting at the bar we realized that it was full service there so we decided to just chill there and order our dinner. We only have 3 people in our party, so it was easier for us. ,Ordered the corn dog shrimp, chicken fried steak, and flank steak. Every entree came with a side. We ordered rosemary fries and Mac n cheese as sides. Yum yum yum! ,Drinks were stiff and complimented the food nicely. Our party agreed we wouldn't order the corn dog shrimp again but it was nice to try. The entrees were out of this world and the best chicken fried steak we've ever had. It was a perfect balance of crispy, peppery, and tender. The flank steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned nicely. We did not want this meal to end. Amazing! Can't wait to visit Austin again to come back to this place.,I still dream about our dinner here at Moonshine. We stopped by on a Friday night with hopes of getting a table.

My husband came here once when he visited Austin for a work conference and loved it, so he made sure I tried the food here too. We went there around 5:30pm on a Saturday and waited for about 20 mins. First impressions: the waiter was super friendly and gave a short spiel on Southern hospitality and how most food here are fried and delicious. Lol. Their complimentary popcorn is to die for. Me and my husband gobbled up the whole thing before our appetizers arrived. I'm not sure what is in the popcorn but that salty goodness was in every single kernel of popcorn! Howw????,We got their Southern Grit Cake, Chicken Fried Steak (its not chicken!), Shrimp & Grits and Apple Pie. We were both totally comatose in the end. Coming from LA you don't get much grits and the grits here were absolutely amazing. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp which was something I wasn't expecting at all. So thank you!!! Apple pie was super delicious too, especially with the vanilla ice cream, not sour at all. ,Unfortunately I didn't think their Hard Lemonade with an added midnight moon peace was anything special (recommendation from the waiter). They didn't have paper straws too which was a little disappointing since you would think that a fancy-super-popular establishment like this, in the middle of youthful Austin, would still serve plastic straws. Drinking my heavily iced cocktail without a straw definitely brought down my enjoyment a little.

Still a great experience!,Hubby and I popped in here when we had a couple hours to kill before heading to the airport. (Hot tip: Valet is $9, the lot next door is $15),We walked in around 6pm'ish and there was already a 20-30 minute wait on a Sunday. Crazy. The place isn't as big as it seems. The patio seating seemed pretty small and spread out. Thankfully we were able to snag a couple seats at the patio bar which was a separate area out back from the inside bar (which seemed small).,The bartenders were super friendly (but then again, everyone in Texas seems to be). We were promptly greeted, given great recommendations, etc.,I wasn't super hungry so we got two apps and hubby got himself the chicken and waffles. ,Shrimp corn dogs: The first two were great. Sort of towards the end of the 2nd dog, you realize that it's quite greasy. Still tasty though but I would limit intake to 1.5.,Fried green tomatoes: Likewise, the FGT's were delicious for the first two slices. You do quickly notice the batter is pretty thick and you only barely taste the tomatoes. You mostly taste the breading and the pretty delicious sauce and shrimp on top. So if you're an FGT fan, this dish might annoy you.,Chicken and Waffles: Definitely a great iteration of this classic dish. Hubby gobbled it all up after offering me a perfunctory bite. He didn't manage to finish so I did get a bit more waffles when he was finished. The ""gravy"" was served on the side and lighter than you would have ever hoped for.,At some point, a big group of women who'd just come in from out of town for a conference made their way in, one even standing on the side that was for serve staff only. We got jostled a bit and so we decided to call it a night and head to the airport.,All in all a great spot. We would be open to going back and trying more of their food and drinks.,Cheers!,Hubby and I popped in here when we had a couple hours to kill before heading to the airport.

So if you're an FGT fan, this dish might annoy you.,Chicken and Waffles: Definitely a great iteration of this classic dish. Hubby gobbled it all up after offering me a perfunctory bite. He didn't manage to finish so I did get a bit more waffles when he was finished. The ""gravy"" was served on the side and lighter than you would have ever hoped for.,At some point, a big group of women who'd just come in from out of town for a conference made their way in, one even standing on the side that was for serve staff only. We got jostled a bit and so we decided to call it a night and head to the airport.,All in all a great spot. We would be open to going back and trying more of their food and drinks.,Cheers!,Hubby and I popped in here when we had a couple hours to kill before heading to the airport. (Hot tip: Valet is $9, the lot next door is $15),We walked in around 6pm'ish and there was already a 20-30 minute wait on a Sunday. Crazy. The place isn't as big as it seems. The patio seating seemed pretty small and spread out. Thankfully we were able to snag a couple seats at the patio bar which was a separate area out back from the inside bar (which seemed small).,The bartenders were super friendly (but then again, everyone in Texas seems to be). We were promptly greeted, given great recommendations, etc.,I wasn't super hungry so we got two apps and hubby got himself the chicken and waffles. ,Shrimp corn dogs: The first two were great. Sort of towards the end of the 2nd dog, you realize that it's quite greasy.

He took it away and it took another 20 min to receive our correct order. We found it odd that he didn't just leave it for the table since it was his mistake.,Next, it took forever to get our entrée as well. When my chicken and waffles arrived I was pretty disappointed. The waffles were hard as rocks and both of our plates were cold. I think the server must have forgotten about the food in the kitchen. Well, to top it off, we only saw him again when he dropped off the check and as we were leaving- he was in the front folding silverware.

    ",Salty Sow,"Loved. It. ,A group of 6-7 of us gathered for happy hour and both the food drinks were excellent. So was the service. They have some kind french fries here that are TO DIE FOR. I had some kind of pink margarita with a floater that was super. I didn't pay, so I don't know the prices here, but I expect that they are high. And this place was packed. A happening, edgy, high-income crowd.,Loved. It. ,A group of 6-7 of us gathered for happy hour and both the food drinks were excellent. So was the service.

A happening, edgy, high-income crowd.,We came here for a bachelorette dinner before heading to Rainey St. We had a reservation and were seated fairly quickly. The service was great and they were very accommodating for our large group. I ordered the blackened redfish that came with quinoa, lentils and smoked tomatoes. I really liked that the redfish was large enough to share. However, I found the fish kind of tasteless. The quinoa and lentils gave the fish a bit of texture and taste, but the redfish on its own was not amazing. However, a few people at my table thought this was a pretty outstanding fish. Maybe, it was just me. ,The place was lively and full of happy people.

Thank you SS for an amazing evening!!,We were a party of 5 and ordered meats from across the spectrum: duck breast, crispy chicken thighs, chef's vegetables, blackened redfish, pork shoulder, duck-fat fries, crispy brussels sprouts leaves, and also that chicken liver pate. Everything was cooked with such different technique and flavors, and my mouth is just watering again thinking about all that. I will be recommending SS to everyone I know venturing to Austin. ,Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive, and, I have to hand it to him -- it's not easy! The evening at the restaurant was quite busy already, but he made sure to stop by quite often to check on us. ,We actually only ordered one round of drinks because the food kept us occupied.

There was happy hour from 5 to 6:30PM so we were able to get the appetizers for around 5 dollars. We chose the crispy brussel sprouts and eggplant fries. Both were excellent! The brussel sprouts were so thin and crispy and the eggplant fries were fried to perfection. ,For entree, we got the candies pork belly and crispy chicken. Both were excellent!! The pork belly was so flavorful and tender. I will say that it was a bit salty but this place is called the 'salty sow'- it was still delicious. The chicken was crispy and the fingerling potatoes were so soft and paired nicely.,The service was excellent. We came with my husband's 98 year grandma. She was nervous about cutting up the chicken so she asked me to ask the chef and waiter to cut up the crispy chicken entree. I asked and didn't expect them to but they did! It was so nice and I can't express how much she appreciated it. Oh and they had some deal in July 4th that was buy one entree, get one free so the bill was very reasonable (but this place is already reasonably priced with very good food!),We have been wanting to try this place forever and we are so glad we did!!

Great waiters and pacing,Cons: Desserts are huge but better for sharing :),Salty Sow was good, but not my top pick of things to do in Austin.,We tried the crispy brussel sprouts, crispy chicken thighs, and candied pork belly. Everything was A-OK just not my favorite for the price. I think if you are visiting Austin take a pass and try something more authentic to the city (BBQ). The restaurant is pretty cool itself!,Salty Sow was good, but not my top pick of things to do in Austin.,We tried the crispy brussel sprouts, crispy chicken thighs, and candied pork belly.

The restaurant is pretty cool itself!,Had a great time last night. Came in to have dinner for one. Was immediately seated. The ambiance is great. Trendy place to get together with friends and have a good time. Super packed, but no wait for me! The neighborhood reminded me of downtown Sacramento so I totally dug it.,I ordered the Decero Cabernet Sauvignon, the bone -in filet, brussel sprouts, and the creme brûlée. The filet was delicious! Great flavor and juicy. Devoured it all! Two filets for $24, and you can pay extra for a third. The brussel sprouts were yummy, and were presented as a crunchy salad with a mixture of sweet and salty flavors! I wanted to get the other desserts but opted for the creme brûlée because of the sheer size of the other desserts! All in all, I had a wonderful and complete dinner. Left very satisfied! ,One con was the single seating area which was in a corner, facing the window and the back of the heads of other guests on the other side. Guests opposite of those could see me through the window. Felt like I was being watched eating... Only one server serviced my area so things took a bit. I think my wait would have been okay if I wasn't so secluded. ,Anyway, would be back whenever I'm in Austin! The neighborhood is so trendy and makes me miss home so much!,Had a great time last night.

The food was fresh, well prepared, aesthetically pleasing and tasted incredible. ,The staff was awesome and attentive. We sat on the patio and even though it was hot they had fans to keep you relatively cool. ,One of the best HH menus and options I've seen in the 4 years I've lived here.

My other friend doesn't eat pork and there is a pig in this place's logo but we were able to have an amazing meal without ordering any pork.,We came without a reservation Sunday at 7 PM to a busy restaurant but we got seated immediately.,Menu: This is a new American place that has a significant variety while also maintaining a relatively small menu. It's not so big that you have choice overload.,Setting: Very modern with interesting decor (we noticed that the chandeliers have forks and spoons hanging from them).,FOOD: I will rank what we ordered in the order in which I would recommend it. We all just ordered different things and shared (my favorite thing to do).,Bananas Foster Beignets: DAMN. JUST DAMN. This comes with 4 good-sized beignets filled with bananas and 2 big scoop of nutmeg ice cream. This was more than enough to share amongst 3 people, especially after the meal we had. 100% would recommend finishing with this.,Blackened Red Fish: Perfectly cooked over an amazing sauce (chipotle Tobasco lemon butter - I mean, just read that!),Crispy Brussels Sprouts Leaves: We got this as a side to our burger instead of fries (the waitress was nice enough to let us do that) but I would recommend getting a full order. You can eat these like brussels sprouts potato chips,Special Wagyu Burger: This was on special and was juicy and saucy but wasn't the best burger we've had.,Triple-Fried Duck Fat Fries - came with an egg on top and had to break it over the fries of course and it came with a side of cold bearnaise which wasn't even necessary. Some of the better fries I've had.,Cauliflower and Wild Rice Casserole: I'm not much of a casserole person but this was still good...if you are looking for a vegetarian casserole, this is a great option.,Special Farm Salad: This was on special as well and was just an okay salad, nothing too special,Next time I am in Austin, I will definitely be back.,DINNER REVIEW,What an amazing meal for $35 including a lot of food, a drink, tax, and tip!,The Salty Sow is one of my local friend's favorites so on my last night in Austin, I thought it would a a great place to check out, especially to ward off the Sunday scaries.

Before coming I stalked yelp/ menu (as always ) and originally felt like the menu was super meat/ heavy and kind of ""basic"". This was nothing but the truth, everything we ordered was tasty and seasoned to perfection, with tons of meat and non meat options. The atmosphere was perfect- lighting was on point with tasteful decorations and great service. ,We ordered a few appetizers and they were all good: the bone marrow (interesting and tasty but a little over hyped in my opinion), fried oysters with a chipotle mayo-esq sauce (SO GOOD) and the Caesar salad which was wonderful. ,For dinner we ordered a mix of things but my shrimp special was perfection. The portions for dinner are enough but not huge, so I'd definitely order apps if you are coming with a group! ,Drinks were all 10/10. I had a few of the ""Curly Tail"" which was a glorified marg with smoky salt on the rim which was sooooo tasty / different. The dessert salted caramel budino is like crack!! Especially if salted caramel flavor is your thing. Would highly recommend this place!,This place totally exceeded all expectations.

It's in the neighborhood of Chestnut and they allow online reservations. ,It's a more fancy feeling restaurant, but you don't have to dress up. The space itself is large with several rooms and bars. ,The food is good and comes out fast. We ordered the brussels sprout leaves, beef shoulder, deviled eggs, and the bananas foster beignets.

All tasty, but I'll admit nothing spectacular. The only iffy item was the marinara sauce that came with the eggplant fries - it was slightly watery and didn't really stick to the fries in my opinion. ,The Petey and Carrot Mule cocktails were light, refreshing, and not overly sweet - perfect for a hot summer day.
